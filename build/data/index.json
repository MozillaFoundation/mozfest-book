It\u2019s a very reasonable thing to feel.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, you\u2019ve been reading the news *and* attending MozFest, you might be feeling something slightly different. Something more like: \u2018Oh yeah, the internet is broken. Let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and figure out ways to make it better. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u2019</p>\n<p>The \u2018come on, let\u2019s go\u2019 spirit has been a core part of MozFest since the beginning. Come on, let\u2019s use open source to improve science and education and the news. Come on, let\u2019s create a web literate planet so we can keep the maker spirit of the internet alive. Come on, let\u2019s make the internet as safe and healthy as we can for the 4 billion people around the world who now live their lives online. Come on, let\u2019s go.</p>\n<p>Why is this important? Because MozFest was always designed to be a movement building tool \u2013 a way for people who want to build a healthier digital world to find each other, work together, and create something chaotically and roughly akin to a common agenda. The \u2018come on, let\u2019s go\u2019 spirit provides a common thread. It makes this possible.</p>\n"

Now!</p>\n<p>Another common thread is the \u2018we-build-this-event-together\u2019 model that has underpinned every single MozFest. In 2018, MozFest 2500 people showed up. Over 660 of these people were session Facilitators, Space Wranglers, Speakers, Volunteers, or had some other role in running the event. MozFest is not a spectator sport \u2013 it\u2019s something that the people who show up run together.</p>\n<p>While these two core design principles behind MozFest \u2013 action and participation \u2013 have been a constant over the past 10 years, the world and the movement we\u2019re collectively building have both changed a great deal.</p>\n<p>For the first few MozFests, the call to action really was \u2018let\u2019s use open source to improve education and science and the news\u2019. At the time, the success of projects like Firefox and Wikipedia still felt fresh and exciting. Smartphones were a newish thing. Most of us were optimistic about the internet. The people who showed up at MozFest simply wanted to expand the edges of the open source movement to include more things \u2013 they wanted to make the world more open and free.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, the call to action has become broader and more urgent: come on, let\u2019s make the internet safer and healthier. Now! In the post Cambridge Analytica world, it\u2019s clear to everyone that something is broken about the internet. At recent MozFests, people have been asking just what that something is, digging deep into the problems. The technology? The business model? The lack of diversity? And, in the original spirit, they also show up to build things. Alternative social networks. Software to fight censorship. AI voice agents that are more diverse. MozFest has evolved into a watering hole for people who want to understand \u2013 and tackle \u2013 the somethings.</p>\n<p>When you think about these people \u2013 the people who come to MozFest today \u2013 the thing they have in common is a thirst to make the internet a better place to live, love, debate, work, and play. They may or may not identify as part of a movement focused on \u2018digital rights\u2019 or \u2018internet health\u2019. And, they may come from other movements with long and deep histories of standing up for the rights of people and the planet. However they identify, when they show up at MozFest and as they stay connected through the year, they are a group of people rolling up their sleeves and working on something roughly akin to a common agenda. Which is really all a social movement is.</p>\n"

My experience in conferences and hackdays really informed my decision-making, so I focused a lot on the catering and coffee experience of the 2011 and 2012 editions. I worked closely with Claire Selby, who would become a lifelong friend, to find the best caterer and get coffee trucks set up on each floor, and I worked with the formidable Diana Ilinca to manage our very large pool of volunteers.<br />\nIt tickles me when I\u2019ve been back, either to run a session or catch up with friends, to see how much it\u2019s grown and how large the team is now.

A few years into the relationship, the two worked together seamlessly and the partnership hit its stride. We managed to embed Mozilla projects into the curriculum for both Graphic Design and Digital Advertising, with the Product and Interaction students working on accessibility in the Firefox browser. Truly peak collaboration!</p>\n<p>I remember that the first advocates were the students. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to wear a fox suit and appear on stage? Most of them saw the festival as an opportunity to strengthen their portfolio, and applied to join the Ravensbourne or Mozilla production teams. They were working on everything from making sure people got fed, to running, production, filming, and IT set-up and troubleshooting. Students taking the Web Media course at Ravensbourne acted as live journalists during the festival. And I love the fact that one of those original volunteers who wore the fox suit is now a full time Mozilla employee.<br />\nLike any partnership, Mozilla Festival and Ravensbourne hit bumps in the road over the years.

The experience opened and blew my mind.<br />\nWhen London was touted as a possible followup venue for 2011, I didn\u2019t hesitate to help with the planning. When Michelle Thorne arrived from Berlin (with an umbrella and a bag of Haribos in tow), we hit the streets (pubs, actually) and actively engaged with active local tech communities. These included representatives from Design Jam to Barcamp London to Girl Geek Dinners to London Web Standards and others.<br />\nFreshly armed with our findings and knowledge around what exactly would entice the local community to engage and attend a-hard-to-explain event, we went venue shopping (in the rain). When we later replayed our findings, it was obvious that Ravensbourne stood head and shoulders above others as our venue of choice. It oozed fun with its open and creative spaces. It had little quirks just right for a bunch of misfits trying to reshape the web.

To prepare, we put together a chaotic set of activities including a massive green screen, scrum tables, and scavenger hunts. We covered all surfaces with Post-It notes and built a massive Scrum Board (project tracking structure) of tasks that could be done together, centered on seven themes from Cultural Archives to Glitch Remix to Diversity. These were all suggested through a set of community planning sessions with the 60+ Facilitators who came together to build the track with us. Our aim? To move as many Scrum tasks as possible from \u201cTo Make\u201d to \u201cMade\u201d.

From supporting and co-facilitating various sessions at the festival, to flashing 1000 Firefox OS devices on the fly that were distributed to the participants.<br />\n In 2015, the focus of the Reps changed. Since webmaking and Firefox OS were not a primary focus for Mozilla anymore, Reps focused their energy on teaching people how to organise local communities and how to start local movements. MozFest was an amazing opportunity to advance this work and have it spread to all corners of the globe.<br />\nStaying strong to their commitment, Reps have participated as everything from MozFest Volunteers to Space Wranglers over the years. It\u2019s been an honor to play such an important role in designing and shaping the festival, and we hope to continue the work for years to come.</p>\n"

Over 10 MozFests, OpenNews has helped participants explore how journalism shapes and is shaped by the open web, build skills and conceive of new projects, and find collaborators to keep all of those efforts going long after the event closes.</p>\n<h2>Learning together, celebrating and challenging one another</h2>\n<p>The peer-led, participatory nature of MozFest was developed at a time when the journalism industry was grappling with what it meant to no longer be the sole expert. Each year with MozFest, we\u2019ve seen how organizing sessions around facilitation, and not lecture, allows everyone to learn from the wisdom in the room, instead of the expertise of just a few. This organizing approach inspired our own series of conferences, SRCCON, full of conversations and workshops focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. At SRCCON and MozFest alike, an intentional approach to event design has led to spaces where participants feel able to be open with one another. We often say that a good session is one where you bring a question you\u2019ve been struggling with because you can bet other people have too. And the last 10 years have shown that to be true. By offering supports (including a code of conduct), participants have a chance to ask each other hard questions, share big challenges, and push each other on what it means to do journalism at this moment in time.</p>\n<p>This person-centered, interactive session design has been echoed in what we\u2019ve increasingly heard are part of the answers to those difficult questions: it\u2019s not tech, it\u2019s people. While journalism at MozFest and SRCCON still involves plenty of geeking out about new libraries (or even, the open-source documentation tool named Library!), our work has increasingly moved to answer the questions: how do we support each other as people? How do we serve communities? How do we shift newsroom leadership to be more equitable, inclusive, and really, to operate in whole new ways?</p>\n<h2 class=\"intro\">Space for networks to connect</h2>\n<p>Well, much like Sessions centered around asking questions in group conversations, it turns out the answers are also found via groups. A network of networks has connected and developed through MozFest and SRCCON. Each year at MozFest, there\u2019s been a session of organizers from local chapters of Hacks/Hackers from around the world. The network of local meetups for journalists and technologists has grown enormously over the last 10 years. Two of the largest chapters, London and Buenos Aires, are two of the most frequent participants in MozFest too: creating space for organizers to compare notes, learn from each other, and come up with new ideas. Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires hosts a Media Party, very much in the MozFest spirit, bringing journalists from around Latin America together for talks and hacking, while Hacks/Hackers London received a grant to expand its local work, including better support for working journalists who are also parents and caregivers.</p>\n<p>For five years, we also celebrated the work and growing network of the Knight-Mozilla Fellowship, which brought skilled fellows to newsrooms around the world and helped inspire a whole set of fellowship offerings at Mozilla. Over the course of the program, fellows led Sessions, developed new projects, and have gone on to lead and grow networks of their own, including:</p>\n"

We embrace the unique annual messaging and programming and utilize it as inspiration for exploring a design vision that encompasses the story of the festival. Once the theme has been finalized, research and brainstorming phases begin, which influence conceptual moodboards and audits to produce thematic visuals. The style guides and direction aim to communicate our message visually by building upon a brand that already attracts attention with evocative aesthetics anchored with our standardized logos and lockups. These designs immediately get to work by attracting new audiences to the festival, such as diverse speakers and sponsorship partners.</p>\n<p>Over the years, we\u2019ve refined the design production system which improved internal processes like progress tracking and file structuring and shareable resources such as templated assets and libraries. This enables Staff, Wranglers, and Facilitators to create their own aligned assets as we allow open space for contribution, customizability, and creativity. Helpful style guidelines and graphic libraries are shared amongst our team to efficiently save time and effort to build upon what exists to produce consistent design results. Documentation via open platforms, shared drives, checklists, and style guides is an essential part of the design system for distributed teams who\u2019ll benefit from unified knowledge sharing. Maintaining future reference for adoption is helpful as the festival occurs each year.</p>\n<p>Our design system guides us to create consistent assets while being flexible for customizable variations to create interactive, engaging visuals. For example, this can be applied to a range of assets from stickers, shirts to stages. These opportunities of application can be discovered by creating a user journey map by highlighting touchpoints people encounter throughout the festival. This identifies when and where engaging assets can deliver useful, timely information to attendees when they need it. It\u2019s important to acknowledge the various languages at the festival, accessibility needs, and self expression preferences of our audience. Hackable designs such as name cards, posters, and wayfinding are an invitation for customization and play that involves participation. These are opportunities to bring delight, spark inspiration, or start a conversation that can have lasting impressions beyond the festival weekend.</p>\n<p>Design is an iterative cycle, but we have to be realistic about how much can get done for the year and prioritize according to festival needs and our own team\u2019s annual goals. It\u2019s important to sync the content and copy with the design cycle, as it heavily informs the deliverables. Consistent communication for feedback is essential and preparing for the applications to be useful beyond festival week sets future projects up for success. The design team has an ambitious mindset to make improvements each year to evolve our approach and to face new goals and challenges in future festivals to come.</p>\n<p>Brand and experience design systems help deliver our vision consistently as we anticipate for growth and scale of the festival. As we prioritize our message and design each year, it matures alongside the festival\u2019s maker culture to be more approachable and accessible which amplifies our reach to a broader audience. Mozilla Festival is growing in popularity and participation, so this impact spreads the awareness of community contributions for a healthier internet. It\u2019s been a key, tangible example of our brand expression and interactive platform. MozFest has been a collaborative playground for experimentation and ideation with results that increased the visibility of the event, the movement, and Mozilla. It has informed how we design a socially interactive and engaging experience to evolve the brand while elevating the concept of internet health to the world.</p>\n"

As the concept grew legs, lots of the original idea faded away and were replaced with new ones to really challenge festival attendees.</p>\n<p>For example, BBC\u2019s Research and Development (R&amp;D) team, Matt Shotton and Frank Melchior, had hacked together the concept of a digital audio/recorder which listened to conversations then picked out key sentences to repeat at random times of the day. They called it a \u2018conversation box.\u2019 At the same time, R&amp;D colleagues in the London lab were interested in taking the conversations and printing them out on dot matrix printer to hang them around the festival. Further pushing the concept that the things around you were listening to you. The original concept of the \u2018conversation box\u2019 didn\u2019t quite make it to MozFest, but we decided to take the concept and do something else in the same vein.</p>\n<p>While planning for the festival\u2019s version of the \u2018conversation box,\u2019 it was clear the caf\u00e9 needed a sign or alert for a privacy aware audience: that\u2019s where the idea came to fence off the space with a warning. Handwritten, end user licence agreements (EULAs) were used, as this was one of the most identifiable stumbling blocks of internet of things devices and online services.</p>\n<p>With this in place, anyone who passed over that threshold effectively agreed to our EULA. Which meant we could do almost anything within the space. And that\u2019s exactly what we did\u2026</p>\n<p>Libby Miller &amp; Andrew Nicolaou had been working on a project using Bluetooth and WiFi snooping. Matt Shotton had been doing something similar using WiFi so they combined both to produce a prototype for the \u201cwalls have eyes\u201d (WHE).</p>\n<p>This WHE installation used Raspberry Pis embedded into small picture frames, all kitted out with cameras and WiFi USB cards. When triggered by an ultrasonic distance sensor (when someone walked in-front of the sensor), the camera took a picture and applied face detection to the image. At the same time, the WiFi cards looked for local devices to extract MAC addresses and information about the network connections the device had recently made. This was inspired by the discovery that similar technology was being used to track how -people shop in shopping centres and their paths around the city of London using in tech-enabled recycling bins.</p>\n<p>It was important that the installation had some sort of take-away for people who had experienced it. We decided to give them a physical souvenir of their data (and a promise that the digital version was duly destroyed). Our dot-matrix printer printed out an ASCII version of the image we captured (with the Raspberry Pi camera) a device identifier (Apple, for example) and a list of the MAC addresses of networks recently connected.</p>\n<p>As Ravensbourne University\u2019s open-concept layout didn\u2019t have walls and doors as such, we marked with yellow tape a line on the ground to define the experience\u2019s area. We posted our handmade EULA at the entrance and positioned the popcorn and drinks just out of arm\u2019s reach. Festival-goers had to cross the line to reach them, and they had to grapple with the fact that doing it meant accepting our (frankly quite ridiculous) terms. I have always been interested in what people will give up for free stuff. It\u2019s the ethical dilemma we face everyday but don\u2019t really think too much about.</p>\n"

The son ran past the line to get free popcorn and smoothie but his dad stood on the line and read the EULA asking what\u2019s happening beyond the line while we made his son a smoothie. He then spoke to his son about the importance of reading the EULAs before diving in on free treats.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the weekend, we printed out the gathered data and hung the information across the festival\u2019s entrance in a gesture similar to airing your dirty laundry in public. The effect was incredibly surprising and divided the privacy-aware MozFest audience; some said it was interesting to see but there was no way they would be happy if it was their data.</p>\n<p>This caf\u00e9 was a thought-provoking intervention, and at the time it really scared people \u2013 which was the desired effect.

More than a hundred artists have engaged in Artists Open Web since then, their artworks covering topics that have included data literacy, digital inclusion, open innovation, decentralisation, online privacy, and security. The focus of the exhibits and artworks, which evolved each year, varied. Some took a documentary approach, others were structured as complex systems, and others experimented playfully with new technologies and artificial intelligences. In doing so, Artists Open Web has encouraged new collaborations and critical thinking around the exploration of new technological worlds, from big data to post-humanism. It has also enabled the work of upcoming digital artists to be featured in galleries at MozFest and beyond, while facilitating new explorations of the impacts of creative digital practices, from conceptualising to prototyping, and re-making to experimenting.</p>\n<p>A key thread running through all of these subsequent engagements with art and culture at different MozFests has been to explore the possibilities of what can happen when creative producers are encouraged to engage with an \u2018open\u2019 web, and ensure their voices are heard in contemporary debates about how it is managed, accessed, and controlled. This applies both to those who already identify as creatives, and also those who don\u2019t yet &#8211; but might one day, if given enough encouragement. We have been able to engage with a wide diversity of people who have creative ideas, from fine artists to coders, journalists to sound designers, educators to students, human rights organisations to experimental mixed-media artists. Because everyone has worked together to build each exhibit, gallery and creative intervention, these differences have become strengths. Like the web itself, it is through these kinds of ever-evolving, decentralised and networked multitudes that our world itself evolves for the better.</p>\n"

Year on year, we invest heavily in shaping public -policy that -contributes to and advances a healthy internet, and we work to raise awareness among the public so they too can shape -society as conscious choosers.</p>\n<p>Put simply, we can\u2019t do this alone. We need people to be engaged, to stand up for our shared principles, and to demand that the promise of the internet be upheld.</p>\n<p>MozFest is the perfect place to drive this sort of engagement. Our smart, global, motivated community shares knowledge about how these issues manifest themselves around the world, and shares tools so that everyone can stand up for the open internet.</p>\n<p>Our journey at MozFest started in 2013 in the Look Who\u2019s Watching track (back when there were tracks) where participants learned how to control who gets their data, and helped others protect their privacy and develop long-term solutions to tracking. We launched Lightbeam, the Firefox Add-on to expose the hidden data collection by third-party companies and high-light the lack of transparency, new to us in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations. Our Lightbeam demo struggled a bit since the Wi-Fi wasn\u2019t always strong, but it was a great conversation-starter!</p>\n<p>In 2014, the sense of urgency around the internet was gaining steam. In the post-Snowden world, a lot of our language was about \u201cfighting\u201d and \u201cprotecting.\u201d We wanted folks to be inspired to take action, and not scared of the seemingly endless doomsday scenarios. Although the track was plainly named Policy &amp; Advocacy, our activities included a \u201csuperhero photo booth\u201d that celebrated that we are all heroes of the web. Throughout the festival, people dressed up in superhero costumes, took selfies, and tweeted them to their networks with #WebWeWant.</p>\n<p>On the mainstage, we announced what was then called the Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellows, a new program recruiting tech leaders to work at nonprofit organizations that are protecting the open Web. Our sessions spanned issues like kids safety, net neutrality, anti-surveillance, and skills like the secrets of successful campaigns, tools of the trade, and how to use trouble to your advantage.</p>\n<p>Over time, MozFest participants started to see policy &amp; advocacy approaches as part of the core solution-set to addressing the various problems at stake.</p>\n<p>In 2015, MozFest\u2019s overarching focus was on leadership, advocacy and impact: <em>We\u2019ll train tomorrow\u2019s leaders, empower participants to make a positive difference on the web, and work toward universal web literacy</em>.</p>\n<p>We named the Space Digital Citizenship to align with the focus on skills-building around advocacy. We invited experts on human rights, cyberbullying and online harassment, mobilization and community building, and tools-building to share their knowledge. We hosted a Depressed Cakes pop-up to raise awareness about the damaging effects of cyberbullying, and donated all proceeds to MIND, a UK mental health charity.</p>\n"

How could we promote real change at MozFest, and not just talk about it?</p>\n<p>So in 2016 we named the Space Fuel the Movement and brought the EU Copyright Campaign, along with many of our network allies working on the campaign across Europe. We focused on how intellectual property rights should foster innovation and creation, not notice and take down. Our main struggle was that the vote in Parliament was scheduled for October 10th, 2016 before MozFest. But with heated debates still continuing in the European Parliament, we worked to inspire participants to take action and tell their friends how to defend their right to memes.</p>\n<p>Conversations were popping, discussing what openness really meant in the face of legislative proposals to regulate user-generated content. Participants sent postcards to their Member of the European Parliament through our campaign website, and used #FixCopyright on Twitter. In her post-MozFest blog, Natalia Mileszyk (another Facilitator) wrote, <em>\u201cThe variety of sessions created a space for reflection about the direction of the movement, and helped us understand and prioritize our issues within a global perspective.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>2016 was the last year policy &amp; advocacy had their own Space at MozFest, and we couldn\u2019t be happier. The goal was always for policy &amp; advocacy to be seen as approaches in tackling problems, not to be stand-alone topics. With the five issues as the core Spaces of MozFest in 2017, it was now our focus to support the Space Wranglers. With strong collaboration, we helped identify solid proposals within each of their Spaces, effectively creating a curated \u201cpolicy &amp; advocacy pathway\u201d across MozFest. We thought this consultative role would be the on-going relationship from then on, but by 2018, MozFest Space Wranglers saw the importance of integrating policy &amp; advocacy into their Spaces on their own.</p>\n<p>The world has changed a lot in the last 10 years, and the Mozilla community\u2019s role in raising awareness and creating pathways for change through policy &amp; advocacy in society has resulted in a major shift at MozFest and around the globe. We are humbled that the movement sees the importance of this work, and that our beautiful, eclectic, global community is continuing to build and demand the open internet we were promised.</p>\n"

The approach was appealing and I was keen on -experimenting with<br />\nthe design of our Privacy &amp; Security Space. But lack of time and experience made us focus on other necessities.</p>\n<p>That year at the festival, as I was looking for Sessions related to queer/LGBTIQA+ topics, I only found a couple in the schedule. The session I attended, \u2018Queering Privacy through Queer Hacking\u2019 led by security researcher Sarah Lewis, was full.</p>\n<p>The year after, I attended MozRetreat in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, and had no clear idea of what I would do as a Space Wrangler for the next MozFest edition. This turned out to be an excellent thing: the Retreat is designed to help people build their vision for the festival, but it also provides time and resources to find brand new ideas.</p>\n<p>In Eindhoven, we were immersed in an environment fostering experiments combining art and tech. One afternoon, designer Olle Lundin presented the \u201cQueering the Collection\u201d and \u201cDeviant Practices\u201d programmes at the Van Abbemuseum, a museum of modern and -contemporary art located in central Eindhoven. Lundin presented queering as a practice, as a way to give -visibility to LGBTIQA+ folks in art, and as a way to occupy space at the museum in a different way and engage with visitors.</p>\n<p>The idea clicked for what we could do at MozFest: replace \u2018art\u2019 by \u2018tech\u2019, \u2018museum\u2019 by \u2018MozFest\u2019 and you\u2019ve got the start of the Queering MozFest Experience.</p>\n<p>Chosing the label \u2018queer\u2019 instead of \u2018LGBTQIA+\u2019 was on purpose. By \u2018queering\u2019 the festival, we wanted to look at the world in a way that challenges what we expect to be \u2018normal\u2019, and to be the norm. As such, \u2018queer\u2019 allows us to position our gender and sexuality in a way that questions normalization and marginalization processes inside the white, ableist, cissexist, hetero-patriarchal, and capitalist system. It is about how our bodies and our practices which are deemed abnormal, strange, or dangerous still exist, resist, and occupy space inside our societies. And we connected this queering experience with tech issues.</p>\n<p>At MozFest, we wanted to encourage LGBTQIA+ folks to submit sessions about topics they cared about. This meant drafting a dedicated call for proposals for this Space and engaging directly with them/us to explain what we meant to achieve, both inside and outside the MozFest Wrangling teams.</p>\n<p>We also closely collaborated with queer designers and artists to develop a \u2018queer territory\u2019 within the festival \u2013 to bring the weird and unexpected stuff.</p>\n<p>We received about 30 proposals during the call for proposals and accepted 17 of them. Thanks to the help of the Space Wranglers, we were able to embed most of the Sessions in all areas of the festival for maximum visibility and outreach: Privacy &amp; Security, Openness, Decentralisation, Digital Inclusion, and the Youth Zone. Artists also displayed their works in the Data+Art gallery and we set up a Queer Space to host specific sessions throughout the weekend, next to a lounge space and a giant unicorn.</p>\n<p>The Queering MozFest experience was kicked off during the Plenary Session of the festival, for all to see and hear.</p>\n<p>We were everywhere. As we very likely have always been, but not in such a visible and open way!</p>\n<p>According to the feedback we got before, during and after the festival, the Queering MozFest Experience apparently struck a chord with people. In 2019, a new team had taken the lead to make it happen again: within the same frame of respect and inclusion, it will mutate and explore new directions. And this is the best we can wish for such a <em>queer</em> experience.</p>\n"

Platforms and languages that became popular and don\u2019t ensure compatibility delegate an important burden on their users: the users have to keep up the pace with the changes. They need to constantly update their applications to ensure they will keep working. At each major evolution, such platforms risk losing users who don\u2019t have the time to update it.</p>\n<p>The web took the other path, choosing to maintain backward compatibility.</p>\n<p>As any extension to the web platform will stay forever, at least as soon as websites start using it \u2013 the task of the browser makers is daunting. Each new feature has to be carefully evaluated: usefulness, design, security must be studied to be sure it will not bloat the system or be a hazard in the future. This is a complex task and it takes several years for a new feature to go from the design stage to production-ready and stable.</p>\n<p>Over the years, decentralisation, while positive in most regards, is not picture perfect. The internet, networks and web protocols are all decentralised \u2013 distributed servers host different websites \u2013 which means more and more complex services are needed that are not a part of the official infrastructure. For example, mapping services, and speech recognition websites are complex and are usually hosted remotely by large companies. This concentration of features is a centralisation force: even if the infrastructure itself stays decentralised, these features aren\u2019t. As more and more services are needed, the decentralisation of the web is again a challenge.</p>\n<p>Similarly, large social media services try to create silos for content in order to keep their customers. They ease the publication and discoverability of the content but make sharing outside the silo difficult. These silos undermine the original fundamental decentralisation of the web: and create bubbles, that coupled with targeted advertisements, can segregate a specific population, altering its perception of the world.</p>\n<p>The web has also attracted all kinds of bad actors to a platform that has not been designed to resist such threats: identity theft, bullying online, fake news, and discrimination by both users and Artificial Intelligence, and countless other issues invade our -digital world. These problems are openly and heavily debated. The solutions may be technical, but as they limit the legendary freedom of the web, public awareness is critical.</p>\n<h2>MozFest: A solution and a challenge for our generation</h2>\n<p>Open forums and discussions are fundamental in maintaining the success of both technologic and humane advances of the web. MozFest has served as a catalyst for these types of conversations and progression over the last 10 years. It is helping build up the internet health movement by fueling numerous discussions to enhance and build upon the positives while detecting the different threats and trying to find creative solutions.</p>\n"

Taking over Ravensbourne\u2019s ground floor, the Pop-Up represented twelve partner organisations from the Hive. Each organisation brought an activity for youth. Around 60 young people flocked to the Space. In an activity facilitated by New York City\u2019s DreamYard art center, they imagined their ideal tech-enabled creative hang-out space and molded tiny furniture to fill it. They collected audio interviews with youth radio initiative Radio Rookies, designed board games with New York-based Institute of Play, and much more.</p>\n<p>The 2011 Hive Pop-Up laid the groundwork for the Youth Zone in the years to come: a collaboratively produced Space, with a focus on play, exploration, imagination, risk-taking, failure, and discovery for young people \u2014 and the young at heart. These offerings, like the festival as a whole, were a collaborative venture, shaped by ideas, and insights from a variety of contributors. In 2012, new partners came on board including educators from Black Girls Code, Coder Dojo, London Zoo, the creative technology non-profit MOUSE, Digital Me, and Global Action Project. The 2012 Space featured a \u201cHacktivate Learning\u201d track, design challenges, a Youth Laboratory, and hands-on hacking in the Games Arcade.</p>\n<p>Dorine Flies, a 2012 festival attendee and parent, came on board as a key contributor in 2013.

Little did I realise that this would foreshadow the session\u2019s ending.</p>\n<p>Just as the session was coming to a close there was a loud BANG, a flash of light and every screen and light in the room went dark. We were running power from boxes that were set into the floor. As it turns out these boxes were designed in a way that the cover would sit flush with the rest of the floor, with a hole at the edge for cables to run through. If you didn\u2019t quite arrange the cable correctly, the cable would sit between the lid and the lip of the box, pinched between the two. Add to this a day\u2019s worth of people walking over the box and the insulation of the cable was slowly worn&#8230; At that point \u2013 BOOM \u2013 you get an electrical short, resulting in a flash of light, an audible bang, and a quick trip to the building management team with your tail between your legs as you very politely ask them to flip the breaker back on.</p>\n<p>In theory, that electrical fault could have easily caused a much wider issue \u2013 it only took out power for the single floor, but as Ravensbourne University is located right next to the concert venue O2, the possible consequences are obvious.

              "text": "<p>\u201cFor me, the festival opened so many new worlds. Every time I spoke to someone \u2013 in the coffee queue; in the workshops; sitting over lunch \u2013 they were doing or making something incredible. They were open and willing to share it. However, the thing that really hooked me was the energy in the Youth Zone. There\u2019s so much excitement in the Space \u2013 young people know what they like and dislike and they don\u2019t waste time not telling you about it. Magical things happen when we take young people seriously. When we listen to their opinions and ideas and give them a platform to show what they can make.</p>\n<p>In 2018, we had an open makerspace where we invited participants to make robots or inventions of any sort and helped them add small circuits to them. A little girl entered the Space who was quite shy and a little overwhelmed by the festival. Then, after seeing the materials she proceeded to make a huge claw machine taller than she was\u2014using just tape, cardboard and pure innovation. She managed to add lights and pretend prizes and a whole claw contraption. We were all blown away. Her dad later found the Space Wranglers on Twitter to tell us that he had never seen his little girl become so confident and interact so much in a room full of strangers.</p>\n<p>Anyone who\u2019s been involved in the Youth Zone can attest that if you really care about the internet and protecting it, you must engage the next generation of internet users and builders in your conversations. There are no better partners!\u201d</p>\n"

It has had a huge impact on our lives, as I\u2019ve met so many people and learnt so many things&#8230; like how to prepare for and present workshops that reach more age groups, improve and be more confident in my public speaking and presentation skills, as well as developing my computer skills and knowledge of the internet from each workshop that I presented and attended. I took part in a discussion panel during MozFest 2018 with a wide range of people of different ages, which was a new and exciting experience for me. I was also interviewed on camera by the organisers, which I hadn\u2019t done before.</p>\n<p>I was 11 at my first MozFest and now I\u2019m 14, I\u2019ve been every year and loved attending all of them. I have friends with whom I stay in contact with throughout the year, and new skills I can use, as well as more confidence that comes from delivering workshops. I think a key moment every year is the welcome presentation, when all MozFest participants sit together and get introduced to MozFest- it dawns on me, at that moment, how incredible the community at MozFest is. :)\u201d</p>\n"

With this hyper-speed blending of our digital and analog lives, web learning and development for much of the world was becoming critical.</p>\n<p>Global economies were slowly picking themselves up off the floor of an almost full collapse and techno -optimism was motivating this slow-burn recovery. The recovery was partially fueled by a technology sector that seemingly had a solution to any of our problems. Have a social problem? There was an app for that! Techno utopia was the spirit of that age.</p>\n<p>It was an exciting time in this web 2.0 world. As we embodied this Techno utopia, there was a growing desire to create a world where people understood the web, its principles, and the platforms that make it. It is this ethos that led to the growing movement of web producers and makers. Education early adopters were armed with paperback copies of Seymore Papert\u2019s <em>Mindstorms: Children,</em><br />\n<em>Computers, and Powerful Ideas</em>, and issues of <em>Make Magazine</em>. We were ready to program, not be programmed!</p>\n<p>Mozilla and our allies were excited to participate in the emerging movement of foundations, non-profits, universities, governments, start-ups and grass roots educators. Digital storytelling, web mechanics, coding, new tools \u2014 helping to define what it means to be literate in the 21st Century. It felt current, important, and fun. We knew that teaching a holistic set of digital skills was more than just learning to code or building out the STEM career pipeline. We believed it was an evolution of the fundamental skills and competencies needed to read and decipher the frighteningly fast world around us. This wasn\u2019t just a new subject, this was a seismic shift in how the world works and civil society better figure out how to teach the web. We wanted to help.</p>\n<p>Looking back on 10 years of this work, the pivotal moment for Mozilla\u2019s focus on web literacy was the development of the Hackasaurus web tool (later renamed X-Ray Goggles). From the imaginations of two friends and collaborators, Jess Klein and Atul Varma, this web app would allow you to turn on a view source tool that lets you see, understand, edit and re-publish the web. It was like having special glasses that revealed a deeper, more detailed reality than what loaded in your browser, often referred to as a peek behind the web screen. Mozilla had found a curricular inspiration for our ideas around being web literate.</p>\n<p>Emanating from the spark Hackasaurus/X-Ray Goggles provided Mozilla and the forming open digital education community it was coraling, Mozilla launched the first Summer Code Party in 2012. This amplified Mozilla\u2019s efforts to teach how to read, write, and participate on the web at global scale. Mozilla\u2019s Hive Learning Networks where crucial to building communities in local cities like NYC, Toronto, Chicago, Pittsburgh and others to help develop the web literacy skills of youth while catalyzing local movements to help educators innovate in digital learning. Together Summer of Code Party (renamed Maker Party in 2013) and Hive Learning Networks were supporting a movement of teaching crucial 21st century skills and web literacy to informal educators, teachers, and advocates. By 2015, there were thousands of \u201cMaker Parties\u201d in hundreds of cities every year, teaching people of all ages to learn the web.</p>\n"

These tools made it easier to use the actual languages of the web like HTML, CSS, and Javascript to be creative. These experiments helped demonstrate how web literacy skills like collaboration, openness, remixing, and coding could be facilitated and acted as starter software for people who would later graduate to more mature tools. These web making tools helped seed further innovation in other popular web tools and projects such as the Hour of Code, Glitch, and Scratch.</p>\n<p>There also needed to be a rigorous rationale to bring the concept of web literacy closer to the mainstream of academic thought and practical application. The Web Literacy Map, co-created by Doug Belshaw (Open Educational Thinker) and the Mozilla community, and further developed by An-Me Chung (Fellow at CS4ALL) and partners, was a matrix of skills and competencies one needed to be web literate. This framework has since been adopted, remixed, and evolved as people in wider education communities pick up the map and advance them in their own local contexts. This think tank style work was validated by the Brookings Institute when it published an article in their Skills for A Changing World series written by Mozilla\u2019s Executive Director Mark Surman and Mozilla Fellow Meghan McDermott.

Now, in the 10th year of MozFest, it is a Space for a movement that seeks to make web literacy a core modern skill along with reading, writing, and maths. It has been a gathering space for projects with audacious goals like \u201cCities of Learning\u201d, \u201cComputer Science for All\u201d, and \u201cOpen Education.\u201d</p>\n<p>None of this was by accident, the simple pleasure of teaching and learning has always been at the core of the MozFest design. Participatory and self guided, but well organized and conceived, is the pedagogical mission of the event and the best ways for people to gain digital skills. The web literacy spaces through the years have been able to balance a wide range of educators, youth, scholars, developers and activists, holding both the technical and metaphorical aspects in tandem. Over the decade the Spaces were curated and lead by a wide range of Mozilla Staff, community members, and UK edtech champions like Su Adams and Dorine Flies.</p>\n<p>MozFest served as the crucial point of the year where the global community would come together to learn and share their experiences. Leading by example, web literacy programming was hands-on and engaging by nature and focused on individuals of all ages sharing games, technology, and programs that taught web literacy. Individuals gathered to test new tools like Erase all Kittens, or develop new learning games, or share what worked in their Mozilla Club in Kenya, or explore digital animation through green screens.</p>\n<p>The web literacy program areas always had flair. From -bedazzled lab coats to circus chic themes, the participants always enjoyed the curated Space. One year you entered a Carnival of Learning where you could demystify the web, or as Space Wrangler Kim Wilkens explained, \u201cEmbrace the unknown! Experience the thrills!

And it\u2019s promising to see other countries looking toward this legislation as the benchmark while they look to regulate the internet themselves. But we see GDPR as the floor, not the ceiling, of what\u2019s possible in an internet that puts people first.</p>\n<p>The future of the internet is full of complex privacy issues, especially when it comes to AI and machine decision making. We\u2019ve already rolled up our sleeves and started work on these topics. We\u2019ve called out eavesdropping AI assistants, called Facebook to account for disinformation, and interrogated YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm.</p>\n<p>While companies have been collecting data about users and making assumptions about their preferences for decades, modern machine learning has accelerated this process and is so embedded into the modern internet that it\u2019s hard to go anywhere online without unintentionally giving away details about ourselves.</p>\n<p>One powerfully negative consequence of this lack of governance has been a reinforcement of discrimination against specific groups of people. Some of this information \u2013 like sexual orientation, politics, religion, ethnicity, and more \u2013 has serious implications for the safety of people if their governments (or others) ever found out.</p>\n<h2>Working Towards Strong Privacy Practices Within A Healthy Internet</h2>\n<p>As people expose themselves to different digital vulnerabilities, we need to teach online privacy at an extensive level. Mozilla will continue to work with policymakers, companies, and affected communities in looking into solutions that ensure user privacy is paramount in the future of the internet.</p>\n<p>Over the years at MozFest, we have seen many Facilitators introduce new and creative ways to point out ways users can take control of their online privacy. Every year, more participants leave MozFest with a few more tools to protect their well-being online, and a little more emboldened to demand that technology respect people.</p>\n<p>The festival has given us, and continues to give, the opportunity to connect with the broader community and organise around issues like privacy, security, and our digital rights. It also allows us to come together and build open tools that make the web a better place.

A video that can trigger actions on an interactive map; a video that can dynamically incorporate tweets and other data, mise en sc\u00e8ne; Gaylor and Humphrey imagined these and other clever uses of the HTML5 video API, rolled them into a Javascript library, and called it Popcorn.js.

Educators from Yorkshire to California are testing \u2018Open Badges\u2019, a brand-new means of capturing and expanding achievements made on a local scale onto the world wide web. From working with young people to veterans, from coding to cookery, these educators ignite a passion for learning, leading to personal developments in curiosity and problem-solving, both easily applicable in other real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, this type of inspired learning is often overlooked by the education system.</p>\n<p>It is generally agreed that the old model, where schools and universities have sole responsibility for learning, is outdated and slow to change. This system, on average, fails 30% of learners across countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who leave with no qualifications for life after education. This can lead to a collapse in self-esteem and talented people are easily overlooked.</p>\n<p>So how can we move towards a situation where education offered online and in new, informal settings is placed on equal footing with institutional learning? After all, creativity, problem solving, and the ability to learn and relearn are precisely the skills we need to thrive in an unpredictable job market.</p>\n<p>Rewind to 2012 and Mozilla launches Open Badges at MozFest.</p>\n<p>Open Badges are visual representations of a person\u2019s learning or experience, designed to be shared on social media and online CVs for maximum visibility and recognition. They are awarded to individuals and signify achievements, from completing a code club project to attaining a formal qualification. Each digital badge is packed with data, providing context about the achievement \u2013 who did something, evidence of what they did, and who says they did it, all of which can be digitally verified in real-time.</p>\n<p>These new digital credentials are the result of a collaboration between Mozilla and MacArthur Foundation, who saw the opportunity to harness the power of the internet to give individuals, employers, and educators a new common language to communicate skills across the web in any given setting. MozFest was the perfect place to launch this initiative.</p>\n"

And like email, it enables data to be sent, received, and understood between different technology vendors, even between competitors. With a single standard, people can create and communicate a rich portfolio of achievements from across multiple online, formal, and informal settings.</p>\n<p>Educators now had a new, easily accessible tool to recognise learning in any setting. Open Badges made significant progress within two years. The recognition granted through the project enabled new-found confidence for learners and helped people tell the story of their learning.</p>\n<p>Research on effective badge design was published in \u2018Promising Practices of Open Credentials\u2019 by Sheryl L. Grant and learning providers began using credentials to demonstrate the impact of their programmes. Although the project had a positive impact within organisations, learners wanted to know how they could use their credentials beyond education to build their own enterprise or access job opportunities.</p>\n<p>So while Open Badges showed the potential to deliver global societal benefits, employers, educators, and platforms would all need to embrace the standard. The \u2018badge ecosystem\u2019 was supplying badges, and it now needed to generate demand for them. Only then could individuals use them as currency to unlock opportunities for work or further learning.</p>\n<p>A stalemate had arisen. Learners and educators wanted proof that employers would recognise badges, whereas employers needed proof that educators would issue badges. Platforms and governments wanted to know whether Open Badges would become the global standard for sharing skills across the web before committing. In short, only once the whole system became connected could learners\u2019 genuinely benefit from opportunities outside of their organisation.</p>\n<p>MozFest provided Open Badges with the platform to widen its community base. The festival is like a pop-up city, embodying the values of interest-led, hands-on learning where everyone is invited to join in. Each year we asked new stakeholders to see badges in action at MozFest, to design the future of the standard and share lessons learned. The enthusiasm proved infectious. Over three years, the community of partners grew from a handful of passionate innovators to a network of 120 stakeholders in the U.K. expanding from grass-roots organisations to include major employers and universities.</p>\n"

We introduced a new facilitation layer, inviting Wranglers to effectively codesign and host participatory, themed Spaces within the festival.

These are individuals who understand the community dynamics in play, and strive to see the needs of fellow participants served. This can be through offering to facilitate sessions that have been requested, by mediating and de-escalating disagreements and tensions, or by communicating to event organizers concerns or feedback they have observed. Put in the vernacular, these emergent leaders are the participants who most readily and passionately \u201cbring the love\u201d to the group as a whole. They are leaders in the cohort by example.</p>\n<p>These Facilitators form an essential middle level in the event structure, helping event organizers to realize their goals by addressing the needs of participants. They become the eyes and ears of the event, listening to feedback, tracking the mood in their small groups, and helping to propagate awareness of interpersonal dynamics that are shaping the tone and outcomes of the gathering.</p>\n<h2>Keep Things Cosy, Comfortable and Well-Fuelled</h2>\n<p>Not to be overlooked in participatory events is the essential nature of \u201clittle logistics\u201d. Meeting rooms should be well-lit and comfortable, with adequate space for participants to sit in a single large circle, and good sound dynamics to assure that even the most soft-spoken individuals are heard. Proper name tags that emphasize first names and de-emphasize last names, titles and affiliations are a powerful lubricant for ad-hoc interactions. And food sourcing is critical: good food (with particular care to individual dietary needs) leads to productive moods, and an ongoing supply of beverages that includes a bottomless pot of coffee keeps people fuelled, hydrated, and ready to fully focus on the proceedings. Breaks should be frequent and not short, both to allow freestyle interactions, and to let participants check in with external realities so they can turn full attention to subsequent sessions.</p>\n"

Event goals should be concrete and phrased in language accessible to all participants; desired outcomes should be achievable in the time frame of the event, and should avoid being couched in \u201cvision\u201d terms.

Participatory events succeed by letting participants collaborate; if Facilitators spend too much time talking, or prioritize process over productivity, the group experience suffers. Too often, event organizers feel pressure to deliver an experience, but participatory events thrive when participants create their own experiences within a well-defined framework of participation. A specific challenge lies in not rushing the schedule; collaboration evolves along its own timeline, and Facilitators who rush participants in order to track to stated agenda time slots undermine the effectiveness of the sessions themselves. Event organizers and Facilitators should trust the process, and position themselves to be effective through understated but attentive support of the participants&#8217; needs.</p>\n<p>Another critical ingredient in participatory events is a strong cadre of experienced Facilitators. While participants should be free to collaborate as they desire, leadership is still required to keep conversations and collaborations coherent and tracking towards goals. Knowing who these Facilitators are before the event starts, and melding their efforts with those of the \u201cemergent leaders\u201d discussed above, yields an optimal \u201cmiddle layer\u201d of facilitative support and guidance.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the hardest risk to model for is the presence of \u201cproblem participants\u201d.

MozRetreats have been held in a tiny coastal fishing village in Scotland, and in Tallinn, Berlin, Eindhoven, and Barcelona.</p>\n<p>The retreat has three stages: grounding participants in the history of MozFest and the current state of the web; collaboratively deciding where to make changes, additions, and improvements; committing to doing the required work and mapping out the practical steps needed to achieve our goals.</p>\n"

Since some retreat participants know very little about the festival before they arrive, it\u2019s important that we share some context. To do this, we celebrate prior achievements of the festival and acknowledge the hard work of others not in the room. And of course, the best part of this initial phase is bonding with one another. MozRetreat is the only time that this group will be together in person until the week of the festival. After the event, everyone will return to their different corners of the globe and subsequent connections happen via video and conference calls, so it\u2019s vital that trusting relationships are forged.</p>\n<p>Stage two of the retreat is about defining the evolution of MozFest by acknowledging parts of the event that are stale and could use revamping, or that represent exciting new territory we\u2019ve never approached. We ask participants to define where they see their own work fitting in, what they are passionate about working on, and who else should be part of the conversation. It is here that roles begin to take shape, and the individuals who will lead the festival\u2019s Spaces and experiences emerge: these are the MozFest Wranglers.</p>\n<p>Wranglers have a deep history and play a critical role. They design and host the Spaces, experiences, and connections within the festival where others can participate and thrive. It is at the Wrangler level that the co-ownership of MozFest exists most profoundly. At MozRetreat, we give Wranglers driving lessons, then hand them the keys to the car.</p>\n"

If Wrangler teams are not gelling, we step in to help.<br />\nIf someone becomes lost in the swirl of ideas, we guide them to find a focus that feels right.</p>\n<p>The final stage of MozRetreat is about making commitments to do the work required and clarifying next steps, like writing the call for proposals. Co-designing a participatory festival is no small task. Combined, the team will dedicate thousands of volunteer hours so it\u2019s critical that the work is distributed as evenly as possible, and that everyone has an opportunity to contribute. This is where the festival production team brings more structure to the process by setting milestones for the curation of sessions, the allocation of travel stipends, and the physical design of festival Spaces and experiences. We outline how the work in these areas is coordinated across various roles, what we expect of the Wranglers, and how we support them in return.</p>\n<p>MozRetreat is an exhilarating, empowering, and highly productive week. It is a key moment in the co-ownership and co-design of the festival: we present a desired outcome and hand the reins to this group to design how we get there. We trust these Wranglers to create something personal that is also an accessible, engaging inroad for MozFest attendees to contribute to a healthy web that matters in their communities.</p>\n<h2>Planning across time zones</h2>\n<p>Post-retreat, Wranglers work together in teams to curate proposals, support Facilitators, design the Space, and schedule the sessions. With many moving pieces to coordinate, we convene in a weekly call, an important mechanism to stay connected, share design updates, raise issues, request peer assists, and ask questions. Documentation is important here, and we capture notes in a central document, record calls for viewing at a later time, and send update emails and task lists that explain the procedures.</p>\n<p>During the months between the retreat and the festival, the production team governs the federated design process and keeps the work moving to meet the deadlines necessary to produce the festival. Access to our team is paramount, whether at the end of Wrangler calls, in smaller groups, or 1:1. We regularly ask for input on our process and iterate as necessary according to the feedback.</p>\n"

By creating an accessible environment where people of all types can collaborate and flourish, Wranglers nurture a vibrant, welcoming atmosphere.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the Spaces that Wranglers design function as mini-festivals. Within each Space, participants can find everything they need: sessions, inspiring talks, art installations, and community. Multiple activities are scheduled at any one time so that even within a Space, attendees can choose their own adventure. MozFest and Ravensbourne are the scaffolding that contain and connect these Spaces.</p>\n<p>During the festival weekend, the focus of the production team is to ensure the frame of the event holds and that the Wranglers are fully supported.

This open request for Sessions is launched each year in July and thousands of people from around the world respond. Expectations are stated clearly in the open call: all Sessions must be collaborative and generative, with a pre-planned way to continue the work post festival. Straightforward presentations are discouraged, unless Facilitators are asking attendees to openly collaborate on their work.</p>\n<p>Once the call for proposals closes and Wranglers have completed their curation, we typically end up with more that 500 individual Facilitators. Wranglers manage the Facilitator relationship by sending emails, hosting open calls, and providing 1:1 guidance as needed. Oftentimes, veteran Facilitators are invited to share their experience and advice.</p>\n<h2>Federated Design in action</h2>\n<p>Again, documentation plays an important role in setting up Facilitators to succeed as festival co-owners. We wrote a Facilitator Handbook to help newbies navigate the very unique MozFest experience, and to guide everyone in the planning and delivery of a great Session. It shares many practical details like where nursing mothers can feed their infants, what dietary restrictions we can accomodate, and the location of the prayer room.</p>\n<p>We also host a half-day Facilitator Orientation on the Friday of the festival weekend. The central goal of this mandatory convening is to establish an ethos of shared ownership of the festival across the diverse range of Wranglers and Facilitators present, and to invite each and every one of them to see themselves as ambassadors of MozFest and the community, spreading goodwill while remaining cognizant of anything that limits others\u2019 ability to enjoy the event.</p>\n<p>Facilitators are encouraged to provide feedback directly to their Wranglers, and also to production Staff. With 500+ Facilitators, this generates a fantastic range of responses that guide the program design the following year.</p>\n<h2>Arrive with an idea, leave with a community</h2>\n<p>When discussing shared ownership of MozFest, we cannot forget the participants. Our invitation is an explicit call to shape the future of the web and attendees arrive ready to share ideas and get their hands dirty \u2013 whether that means writing code, designing games, teaching others, or any of the countless ways to connect and collaborate.</p>\n<p>With more than 600 activities taking place over the festival weekend, participants cannot possibly attend every Session, visit every interaction, or take in every talk. Immediately following the opening plenary, attendees disperse to all corners of the building, a highly personal migration that invites each individual person to design their own journey and set their own pace. Those who dash from Session to Session, committed to seeing as much as humanly possible, create a playful, frenetic energy, while those who settle in to long conversations in Ravensbourne\u2019s many cozy corners remind us that serendipitous connections are one of the festival\u2019s greatest rewards.</p>\n<p>A third of our participants are also Facilitators who are hosting their own activity as some point during the weekend, meaning a huge portion of the audience are bringing their expertise and support to others\u2019 sessions. The continuous exchange of knowledge between attendees \u2013 demonstrated in acts of kindness and empathy \u2013 underpins MozFest\u2019s most enduring tagline:</p>\n"

Back then we both thought the best way to\u00a0 promote a healthy digital society was to celebrate those who were envisioning and engineering positive, pro-social futures. But around the time of the AOL-Time Warner merger, around 1999, it became clear to me \u2014 and I&#8217;m guessing to you, too \u2014 that the net was about to be more about the growth of capital than the growth of culture. As a result, we got the surveillance economy and the attention economy, which instead of helping people create value for themselves and each other, simply use tech to extract value from people and places. Right about that time is when I wrote this weird little piece for Adbusters called \u201cThe Sabbath Revolt,\u201d where I was arguing that people should adopt a \u201cone-seventh rule.\u201d One day each week, not just away from tech, but away from buying and selling.

Specifically, we were talking about the public sector delegating difficult internet regulation tasks \u2014 like counter-terrorism, intellectual property protection, or hate speech \u2014 to private actors.</p>\n",
                    "<p>There is some degree of consensus in the European policy space that there\u2019s a problem with law enforcement on social media. And in some respects, that even goes beyond law enforcement. Like in the UK, you had these initiatives around so-called harmful speech that actually isn&#8217;t illegal, but it&#8217;s considered a problem anyway. Yet there is no consensus about what exactly should be done about it.</p>\n",

Basically they&#8217;re telling a social media company, \u201cThere is crime happening, fix it\u201d \u2014 fully knowing that any tools that would promise anything close to 100% success would have huge rates of false positives, and would violate fundamental rights.</p>\n",

                    "<p>There are three things in what you said that really resonated for me. One is this idea of false positives. On a lot of platforms \u2014 as well as initiatives that I see in Asia, whether it&#8217;s biometric IDs or facial recognition \u2014 they don&#8217;t care about the false positives or the false negatives, because there&#8217;s this narrative that something is better than nothing. That&#8217;s particularly true of developing economies where they feel, \u201cThese are people without consent. They are either digitally illiterate or actually illiterate. They don&#8217;t understand the consequences of what is being developed.\u201d</p>\n",
                    "<p>So this idea of false positives and false negatives is seen as acceptable in order to improve and fine tune a system. And in countries where you don&#8217;t have a lot of guardrails, whether legally or technically, a progress narrative will push through imperfect systems, just because it&#8217;s seen as something in the fight against big social harms.</p>\n",
                    "<p>When I&#8217;ve done work on things like biometric IDs, I&#8217;ve almost thought that they\u2019re beta test-ing surveillance technology on groups and populations in marginalised communities that don&#8217;t have the ability to refuse to be included. And it&#8217;s a similar thing when it comes to the sort of privatisation that you\u2019re talking about: It&#8217;s a privatisation of something that should be within the domain of government and law enforcement. But it&#8217;s being delegated to people who aren&#8217;t necessarily the right fit.</p>\n",
                    "<p>The second thing you said that resonates with me is privatisation. It&#8217;s exactly the same in a lot of domains, whether it&#8217;s trying to create a smart city, or whether it&#8217;s in China or India or somewhere where governments are not necessarily the best purveyors of technology. Governments enter public-private partnerships on everything from health systems, to transport, to energy, to a whole lot of things that are not just about free speech or expression. They\u2019re about very civic basic needs \u2014 needs that are very, very crucial to daily life.</p>\n",
                    "<p>Those are things that are within the domain of governments; that&#8217;s what you pay taxes for. So the idea that those are delegated or even abdicated to private actors is a very disturbing trend. If it was differently designed, I would be happy with the idea of decentralisation. But I don&#8217;t like the increasing monopolisation and platformisation of many services. When you delegate public accountability to private actors that act in self interest and that don&#8217;t necessarily act in the interests of citizens, that&#8217;s a very fundamental shift. You&#8217;re going from a social contract to terms and conditions set by private players.</p>\n",
                    "<p>Julia, you touched on this in your email yesterday: You have certain rights and expectations when it comes to a government player, whether under the constitution, whether it&#8217;s tort law, negligence, consumer protection, or labor laws. Those are rights you may have against a government actor, but that you might lose if services are provided by private actors.</p>\n",
                    "<p>And the third thing that resonated is, what kind of incentives are we creating when we are pushing this onto private actors? In many ways it&#8217;s creating the wrong incentives, like for citizens to increasingly act less as citizens and to act more as users. At the Stockholm Internet Forum, Alix Dunn from the Engine Room said the only two industries where she ever hears people refer to \u201cusers\u201d are the tech industry and the drug industry.</p>\n"

I think the reason why the European Commission is really pushing in this direction is not so much because they&#8217;re malignant and because they want Facebook to rule the world \u2014 not at all. They do it because agreeing on common standards among the countries is too difficult. For example, we don&#8217;t actually have a European criminal law that defines what constitutes criminal hate speech on a European level. Most countries have some sort of national law. Some of them don&#8217;t have criminal hate speech. There are codes of conduct and soft law initiatives. But essentially, the reason why we don&#8217;t have common European laws on a lot of things is because the countries can&#8217;t agree; because the value systems are too different.

Our conception of copyright \u2014 and I think the same is probably true for other legal concepts \u2014 is changing based on what an algorithm can distinguish. For example, the idea of originality, or the ideas of parody and criticism and caricature, are losing importance in copyright law. Because an algorithm can only do pattern matching and can only determine, \u201cIs the copyrighted content there? Then it&#8217;s probably an infringement. Is it not there? Then it&#8217;s not an infringement.\u201d</p>\n",

An algorithm cannot evaluate the severity of a crime or the harm that was caused. But it can evaluate the likelihood of reoffending or other things that can be statistically inferred.

It was basically covering any hosting provider whatsoever and saying they have to respond to law enforcement take down requests within an hour. And it was very clear that from the way that the law was written, what they had in mind was video. They were thinking of YouTube and Facebook. They were not thinking of the comments under a small blog.

So long as the module is available for sale, the license provisions haven\u2019t been violated. The original intent was to allow people to not have to provide source for, say, a resistor, as that is a physical module that\u2019s available for sale. But I can see how the provision could be abused to allow people to put the open hardware label on stuff that\u2019s mostly closed source. In the end, the trade-off seems to stem from the OHL being more concerned about getting people to open up the physical design kits for chips and FPGAs, and less concerned about circuit boards.

So, if you are a silicon vendor doing RTL, all the RTL should be open; if you\u2019re a board designer making PCBs, all the schematics and layouts should be open.

Yes, these actions may make money, but overly relying on money as the sole purpose of each interaction online is unhealthy because we risk monetary value becoming the default online social norm.

Algorithms are great at uncovering new value computationally from disparate datasets. We find value in the meaning they provide when making decisions in critical contexts, while generating monetary value for the organisations that create and own them. The key premise of algorithms is efficiency. Algorithms optimise data for decision-making that we previously did not have before. But humans are not efficient. We are messy and inherently flawed, which makes us human. We value serendipity, community and experiences, which may not be efficient but is impactful.</p>\n"

My MozFest 2019 experience offered me a space to call home as a researcher running community programs in data ethics. I raised awareness on data ethics literacy issues, and offered participants opportunities to encounter value tensions in practice (an ethics tool from value sensitive design) and obtain co-design input into a data ethics literacy card game. In the next 10 years, I\u2019ll be contributing to the efforts in making data ethics literacy accessible to people of all backgrounds because our data is about us. 21st century life is powered by data, and people need literacy skills around creating, using and managing their data with integrity.</p>\n<p>How will you join in on efforts to make the internet your home too?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>This piece is inspired by the work of Shoshana Zuboff.

A couple of years ago, I felt helpless. I felt like there was nothing I could do to contribute to building a better life in my community.</p>\n<p>Since the introduction of internet technology in Nigeria in the late 90\u2019s, the country has become more web literate and dependent on the web for day to day activities. This is very good for our development. However, a significant percentage of the country\u2019s population still remains unaware of the core values of the network. They approach the technology as just consumers with little or no contributions towards developing or advocating for principles that uphold a healthy online ecosystem.</p>\n<p>I was a part of this percentage until 2018, when I came across the internet health community through the Mozilla Open Leaders program. You see, the greatest challenge to the participation of individuals, especially those from developing regions, in the internet health movement is the lack of awareness on the subject matter. Through the Mozilla Open Leaders program, I connected to an extremely resourceful online community of activists and technologists who are dedicated to ensuring a healthy experience online. I learned about working open, community driven\u00a0 projects and collaborations. It was amazing! Suddenly, I did not feel so helpless anymore.

My colleague and I, Esther Mwema, launched our Mozilla OLX project on Open Advocacy for the Internet Health Report at the Moz OLX Launch party in the MoZone. This program commenced in February 2020. It is a 6-week program aimed at equipping youth from underserved communities with the skills required to design and lead open projects for raising awareness on the Internet Health Report within their community.</p>\n<p>As the world moves towards the digital future, we all have a role to play in ensuring that the internet does not break.

This can be done by creating a crowdsourced platform on the \u201ctrust in AI systems for civic rights\u201d to channel information on ways technology and algorithmic systems are used by governments, companies or organisations on rights of association, assembly, expression, participation. Learning can be mapped to inform policy advocacy actions. Research on technological solutions, individual actions and navigation tactics can help create practical guidelines to protect and promote these rights.</p>\n",
                "<p>Second, we need to address how to practically ensure human rights centred design of algorithmic systems. According to the University of Birmingham research team, such design means that algorithmic systems will be human-rights compliant and reflect the core values that underpin the rule of law. It entails systematic consideration of human rights concerns at every stage of system design, development and implementation. The research team proposed translating human rights norms into software design processes and software requirements. Developers seem to become \u2018moral guardians\u2019 of our rights \u2013 but they are not always aware how the solutions they develop may be purposefully manipulated or inadvertently used to stifle rights and freedoms.</p>\n",

As with prior technologies, and especially in the last few years, evidence of a trend towards a renewed version of the digital divide can be found. African countries ranked very poorly in a recently released report on the readiness of governments to adopt and adapt to AI (although this is, at least in part, attributable to the lack of updated information that is found on the websites of many African governments). Uptake of AI in Kenya is likely to be greatest, initially, in the more profitable sectors such as banking and telecommunications, but generally lags behind other regions.</p>\n<p>The availability of open source AI tools is certainly a benefit to developers on the continent. Toolkits are available from global technology companies and are popular among Subject Matter Experts and startups. It has been theorized that AI will be a force for democratization (of technology, access to information, etc.), and this idea is supported by the widespread availability of open source AI tools. The theory assumes, however, that open source AI algorithms released by global tech companies are effective and competitive with AI algorithms in active use by those and other leading companies.</p>\n",

The concept of democratization through AI may, however, be premature or unrealistic in the context of African countries. Successful development of AI-based products generally requires large datasets, and Africa has been called a \u201cdata desert.\u201d Biodiversity on the continent is high, but genetic databases cataloging such biodiversity are few. Climate change will affect Africa at least as much as other continents, but few countries have dedicated satellites for collecting weather data. It is therefore in the disparity of available data where the divide between implementations of AI in Africa and those of other regions will be most greatly observed.</p>\n<p>An unfortunate exception to the data desert is in data pertaining to personal identity. Many African governments are currently implementing digital identification (ID) systems, and in the process, collecting vast amounts of data about their citizens and residents. Such data is valuable for AI algorithms and can be obtained either through leakage (i.e., data breaches) or, sometimes, through official channels. The Government of Zimbabwe, for example, recently sold a data set containing facial images of Zimbabwe citizens to a Chinese company seeking to improve a facial recognition AI algorithm. The ability (or inability) to control data through law or technology is a barrier to ethical implementation of AI.</p>\n<p>A further substantial barrier to implementation of AI projects in some parts of Africa is the lack of trust in automated systems. In Kenya, for example, ATMs are disfavoured, as most individuals would prefer to carry out banking activities with a human. This preference grows stronger where technology and devices are more opaque, or are developed outside of the country. For the benefits of AI to be realized, then, a change is required in such cultural preferences. Alternatively, AI must be implemented in ways that are invisible to the ordinary user.</p>\n"

The solution can only be found in greater levels of transparency. It is currently up to the private sector to disclose their uses of AI and sufficient information about the AI such that those uses can be evaluated.
