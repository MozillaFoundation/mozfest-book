      "text": "<p class=\"intro\">My first MozFest was in 2013. I was working with an external agency tasked with producing the festival. My role was to build a frame to support the program and sessions within. I worked with a super involved and dedicated team of Staff, Vendors, and local Volunteers, all of whom had worked on the festival before and helped me find my feet quickly. It was clear that each had a special bond with the festival and would go above and beyond to help deliver the event, which was something you don&#8217;t often see. Money was not the sole transactionary piece, but something more: care, friendship, and trust.</p>\n"

      "text": "<p>Over the weekend, I was not fully aware of what was taking place in the Spaces, or the Sessions.\u00a0 Not viewing myself as a \u201ctechie\u201d, I supported Michelle Thorne, the Director of the festival at the time, to the best of my ability, but didn\u2019t get too involved in programming. However, over that weekend, I was constantly invited to join conversations, Sessions, and sit with groups deep in talk about a variety of topics completely new to me. In hallway conversations, people wanted to know what my ideas were on themes and concepts. I was invited into round table talks, and welcomed to join in wherever I went. It was this continuous welcoming by the community that really inspired me and made me feel part of something bigger, even when I didn\u2019t know what that was just yet.</p>\n<p>Yes, this festival has a serious job to do, providing a platform for the internet health movement to connect, build, collaborate, and seek new ways to keep the web open, free, and a resource for all. But it\u2019s this sense of comradeship \u2013 the sense of being welcomed and invited in to the heart of MozFest \u2013 that I aim to build into each festival. Having learnt so much from Michelle Thorne, Gunner, Mark Surman, and each and every Wrangler, I aim each year to build something to live up to. Not only to what they aspired to in 2010, but what each Wrangler, Facilitator, Participant, Staff, and Volunteer has invested over the years.</p>\n<p>We hope in this book you will understand more about the festival, that it\u2019s built by many, cherished by all, and finds success because of the hard work of those who return year-over-year to support the event, the work, and each other. As we close the first decade of the festival, we wanted to take a moment to stop and reflect upon what we have achieved, both as a festival and a community. As part of this reflection, it is important to share our story, how we design MozFest, and the evolution of the festival. As we enter a new decade, we seek to take these learnings forward to help us grow, mature, and remain relevant for the next ten years as a festival and as part of the internet health movement.</p>\n<p>This book is laid out to help you see the event from the perspective of those who participate in its design, build, and execution.</p>\n",
