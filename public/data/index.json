And, in the original spirit, they also show up to build things. Alternative social networks. Software to fight censorship. AI voice agents that are more diverse. MozFest has evolved into a watering hole for people who want to understand – and tackle – the somethings.</p>\n<p>When you think about these people – the people who come to MozFest today – the thing they have in common is a thirst to make the internet a better place to live, love, debate, work, and play. They may or may not identify as part of a movement focused on ‘digital rights’ or ‘internet health’. And, they may come from other movements with long and deep histories of standing up for the rights of people and the planet. However they identify, when they show up at MozFest and as they stay connected through the year, they are a group of people rolling up their sleeves and working on something roughly akin to a common agenda.

Everywhere we looked we were facing dystopian futures — how our own data was used against us, lack of accountability and agency with AI, and how easy it is to access extremist content on video. Mozilla understood that defining and narrowing these issues would help us achieve a more long term and sustainable change within Artificial Intelligence — a future of Trustworthy AI. A future where all AI is designed with personal agency in mind and privacy, transparency, and human well being are all considered. We want to see a future of accountability, where companies are held to account when their products make discriminatory decisions, abuse data, and make people unsafe.</p>\n<p>MozFest sessions are the fuel that feed the movement, ensuring we can create change. We need positive energy when what we face is insurmountable. And the community at MozFest was up for the challenge. Healthy AI was too big, too new, and too unyielding to tackle alone.

Over 10 MozFests, OpenNews has helped participants explore how journalism shapes and is shaped by the open web, build skills and conceive of new projects, and find collaborators to keep all of those efforts going long after the event closes.</p>\n<h2>Learning together, celebrating and challenging one another</h2>\n<p>The peer-led, participatory nature of MozFest was developed at a time when the journalism industry was grappling with what it meant to no longer be the sole expert. Each year with MozFest, we’ve seen how organizing sessions around facilitation, and not lecture, allows everyone to learn from the wisdom in the room, instead of the expertise of just a few. This organizing approach inspired our own series of conferences, SRCCON, full of conversations and workshops focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. At SRCCON and MozFest alike, an intentional approach to event design has led to spaces where participants feel able to be open with one another. We often say that a good session is one where you bring a question you’ve been struggling with because you can bet other people have too. And the last 10 years have shown that to be true. By offering supports (including a code of conduct), participants have a chance to ask each other hard questions, share big challenges, and push each other on what it means to do journalism at this moment in time.</p>\n<p>This person-centered, interactive session design has been echoed in what we’ve increasingly heard are part of the answers to those difficult questions: it’s not tech, it’s people. While journalism at MozFest and SRCCON still involves plenty of geeking out about new libraries (or even, the open-source documentation tool named Library!), our work has increasingly moved to answer the questions: how do we support each other as people? How do we serve communities? How do we shift newsroom leadership to be more equitable, inclusive, and really, to operate in whole new ways?</p>\n<h2 class=\"intro\">Space for networks to connect</h2>\n<p>Well, much like Sessions centered around asking questions in group conversations, it turns out the answers are also found via groups. A network of networks has connected and developed through MozFest and SRCCON. Each year at MozFest, there’s been a session of organizers from local chapters of Hacks/Hackers from around the world. The network of local meetups for journalists and technologists has grown enormously over the last 10 years. Two of the largest chapters, London and Buenos Aires, are two of the most frequent participants in MozFest too: creating space for organizers to compare notes, learn from each other, and come up with new ideas. Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires hosts a Media Party, very much in the MozFest spirit, bringing journalists from around Latin America together for talks and hacking, while Hacks/Hackers London received a grant to expand its local work, including better support for working journalists who are also parents and caregivers.</p>\n<p>For five years, we also celebrated the work and growing network of the Knight-Mozilla Fellowship, which brought skilled fellows to newsrooms around the world and helped inspire a whole set of fellowship offerings at Mozilla. Over the course of the program, fellows led Sessions, developed new projects, and have gone on to lead and grow networks of their own, including:</p>\n"},{"type":"bullets","bullets":["<p>Dan Schultz and the Bad Idea Factory team, “a collective of chaotic creatives using technology to make people thinking face emoji”</p>\n","<p>Mark Boas’ work organizing decentralization tracks at MozFest</p>\n","<p>Pietro Passarelli organizing the TextAV community</p>\n","<p>Gabriela Rodriguez’ work advising on inclusion at the Internet Freedom Festival</p>\n","<p>Harlo Holmes’ and Martin Shelton’s work educating journalists around the world about security</p>\n"]},{"type":"text","text":"<p>The many networks the fellows have built, led, participated in, and spread the word on have strengthened the overall journalism-technology community’s resiliency and connection to the many tech worlds adjacent to journalism, too.</p>\n<h2>So, why still tech?</h2>\n<p>As the conversations at MozFest and SRCCON have formed into vibrant, self-sustaining communities&#8230;</p>\n<p>As those conversations have meandered between tech and business and culture and leadership&#8230;</p>\n<p>As all journalism becomes online journalism…</p>\n<p>As the consistent answer to the question “what does the journalism tech community need now?” has been “diversity and inclusion&#8230;”</p>\n<p>&#8230;how does tech still fit into that?</p>\n<p>For us, for the community that gathers at MozFest, tech still fits because tech sits at the intersections.

But that was just the start of the ethical dilemmas faced by the patrons of the café.</p>\n<p>The Ethical Dilemma Café was a provocation created by the web with things Space Wranglers Ian Forrester, Jasmine Cox, and Jon Rogers. As the concept grew legs, lots of the original idea faded away and were replaced with new ones to really challenge festival attendees.</p>\n<p>For example, BBC’s Research and Development (R&amp;D) team, Matt Shotton and Frank Melchior, had hacked together the concept of a digital audio/recorder which listened to conversations then picked out key sentences to repeat at random times of the day. They called it a ‘conversation box.’ At the same time, R&amp;D colleagues in the London lab were interested in taking the conversations and printing them out on dot matrix printer to hang them around the festival. Further pushing the concept that the things around you were listening to you. The original concept of the ‘conversation box’ didn’t quite make it to MozFest, but we decided to take the concept and do something else in the same vein.</p>\n<p>While planning for the festival’s version of the ‘conversation box,’ it was clear the café needed a sign or alert for a privacy aware audience: that’s where the idea came to fence off the space with a warning. Handwritten, end user licence agreements (EULAs) were used, as this was one of the most identifiable stumbling blocks of internet of things devices and online services.</p>\n<p>With this in place, anyone who passed over that threshold effectively agreed to our EULA. Which meant we could do almost anything within the space. And that’s exactly what we did…</p>\n<p>Libby Miller &amp; Andrew Nicolaou had been working on a project using Bluetooth and WiFi snooping. Matt Shotton had been doing something similar using WiFi so they combined both to produce a prototype for the “walls have eyes” (WHE).</p>\n<p>This WHE installation used Raspberry Pis embedded into small picture frames, all kitted out with cameras and WiFi USB cards. When triggered by an ultrasonic distance sensor (when someone walked in-front of the sensor), the camera took a picture and applied face detection to the image. At the same time, the WiFi cards looked for local devices to extract MAC addresses and information about the network connections the device had recently made. This was inspired by the discovery that similar technology was being used to track how -people shop in shopping centres and their paths around the city of London using in tech-enabled recycling bins.</p>\n<p>It was important that the installation had some sort of take-away for people who had experienced it. We decided to give them a physical souvenir of their data (and a promise that the digital version was duly destroyed). Our dot-matrix printer printed out an ASCII version of the image we captured (with the Raspberry Pi camera) a device identifier (Apple, for example) and a list of the MAC addresses of networks recently connected.</p>\n<p>As Ravensbourne University’s open-concept layout didn’t have walls and doors as such, we marked with yellow tape a line on the ground to define the experience’s area. We posted our handmade EULA at the entrance and positioned the popcorn and drinks just out of arm’s reach. Festival-goers had to cross the line to reach them, and they had to grapple with the fact that doing it meant accepting our (frankly quite ridiculous) terms. I have always been interested in what people will give up for free stuff. It’s the ethical dilemma we face everyday but don’t really think too much about.</p>\n"},{"type":"image","image":{"src":"/media/Ethical-Dilemma-Cafe-agreement.jpg","srcset":"/media/Ethical-Dilemma-Cafe-agreement-375x0-c-default.jpg 375w, /media/Ethical-Dilemma-Cafe-agreement-500x0-c-default.jpg 500w, /media/Ethical-Dilemma-Cafe-agreement-750x0-c-default.jpg 750w, /media/Ethical-Dilemma-Cafe-agreement-1000x0-c-default.jpg 1000w","caption":"Ethical Dilemma Cafe privacy notice","alt":"A large piece of paper with handwriting in red ink that explains by entering this space you are providing consent for several privacy issue concerns","width":1464,"height":1868}},{"type":"text","text":"<p>The idea of all these free things within reach but requiring agreement with the physical EULA was powerful. One of my favourite moments was with a son and his dad. The son ran past the line to get free popcorn and smoothie but his dad stood on the line and read the EULA asking what’s happening beyond the line while we made his son a smoothie. He then spoke to his son about the importance of reading the EULAs before diving in on free treats.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the weekend, we printed out the gathered data and hung the information across the festival’s entrance in a gesture similar to airing your dirty laundry in public. The effect was incredibly surprising and divided the privacy-aware MozFest audience; some said it was interesting to see but there was no way they would be happy if it was their data.</p>\n<p>This café was a thought-provoking intervention, and at the time it really scared people – which was the desired effect.

They were joined by remix culture aficionado Erik Nelson, and together they united a diverse group of organisations from Rhizome to Europeana, and Creative Commons to the Internet Archive to help them launch a public call-out for a “living gallery,” which would feature 10 hands-on, digital artworks generated during the 48 hours of MozFest that would be co-created along with festival participants. The call-out got such a strong response that the first-ever ‘Art of Web’ track was born, connecting 40 artists and Facilitators from around the world to bring the living gallery and its workshops to life. Outputs included the creation of an evolving ‘human-user-selfie’ initiative with the artist Alison Hauser, “bots co-creating art with humans” with the developers Forrest Oliphant, Gabriela Thumé, and Vilson Vieira, remixes of Facebook identities through ‘data shadow’ audio puppetry with the artist Stephen Fortune, and cultural skills-sharing Sessions to redesign cultural heritage artefacts through open hardware tools with Aalto University researchers Saana Marttila, Kati Hyyppä, and Christina Holm.</p>\n"},{"type":"image","image":{"src":"/media/Art-Culture-Art-and-Web-mini-zine-artwork-Kat-Braybrooke.jpg","srcset":"/media/Art-Culture-Art-and-Web-mini-zine-artwork-Kat-Braybrooke-375x0-c-default.jpg 375w, /media/Art-Culture-Art-and-Web-mini-zine-artwork-Kat-Braybrooke-500x0-c-default.jpg 500w, /media/Art-Culture-Art-and-Web-mini-zine-artwork-Kat-Braybrooke-750x0-c-default.jpg 750w, /media/Art-Culture-Art-and-Web-mini-zine-artwork-Kat-Braybrooke-1000x0-c-default.jpg 1000w, /media/Art-Culture-Art-and-Web-mini-zine-artwork-Kat-Braybrooke-1500x0-c-default.jpg 1500w","caption":"Mixed Media art from MozFest","alt":"A collage of mixed media art pieces printed in black and white","width":2048,"height":1448}},{"type":"text","text":"<p>Then, in 2016, Tate’s Luca Damiani (who had first facilitated an activity exploring open source culture for the Art of Web track in 2014) and the Victoria and Albert (V&amp;A) Museum’s Irini Papadimitrou came together to launch the Artists Open Web programme, an exhibition programme and community of artists whose work explores society and the open web. More than a hundred artists have engaged in Artists Open Web since then, their artworks covering topics that have included data literacy, digital inclusion, open innovation, decentralisation, online privacy, and security. The focus of the exhibits and artworks, which evolved each year, varied. Some took a documentary approach, others were structured as complex systems, and others experimented playfully with new technologies and artificial intelligences. In doing so, Artists Open Web has encouraged new collaborations and critical thinking around the exploration of new technological worlds, from big data to post-humanism. It has also enabled the work of upcoming digital artists to be featured in galleries at MozFest and beyond, while facilitating new explorations of the impacts of creative digital practices, from conceptualising to prototyping, and re-making to experimenting.</p>\n<p>A key thread running through all of these subsequent engagements with art and culture at different MozFests has been to explore the possibilities of what can happen when creative producers are encouraged to engage with an ‘open’ web, and ensure their voices are heard in contemporary debates about how it is managed, accessed, and controlled. This applies both to those who already identify as creatives, and also those who don’t yet &#8211; but might one day, if given enough encouragement. We have been able to engage with a wide diversity of people who have creative ideas, from fine artists to coders, journalists to sound designers, educators to students, human rights organisations to experimental mixed-media artists. Because everyone has worked together to build each exhibit, gallery and creative intervention, these differences have become strengths.

Our smart, global, motivated community shares knowledge about how these issues manifest themselves around the world, and shares tools so that everyone can stand up for the open internet.</p>\n<p>Our journey at MozFest started in 2013 in the Look Who’s Watching track (back when there were tracks) where participants learned how to control who gets their data, and helped others protect their privacy and develop long-term solutions to tracking. We launched Lightbeam, the Firefox Add-on to expose the hidden data collection by third-party companies and high-light the lack of transparency, new to us in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations. Our Lightbeam demo struggled a bit since the Wi-Fi wasn’t always strong, but it was a great conversation-starter!</p>\n<p>In 2014, the sense of urgency around the internet was gaining steam. In the post-Snowden world, a lot of our language was about “fighting” and “protecting.” We wanted folks to be inspired to take action, and not scared of the seemingly endless doomsday scenarios. Although the track was plainly named Policy &amp; Advocacy, our activities included a “superhero photo booth” that celebrated that we are all heroes of the web. Throughout the festival, people dressed up in superhero costumes, took selfies, and tweeted them to their networks with #WebWeWant.</p>\n<p>On the mainstage, we announced what was then called the Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellows, a new program recruiting tech leaders to work at nonprofit organizations that are protecting the open Web. Our sessions spanned issues like kids safety, net neutrality, anti-surveillance, and skills like the secrets of successful campaigns, tools of the trade, and how to use trouble to your advantage.</p>\n<p>Over time, MozFest participants started to see policy &amp; advocacy approaches as part of the core solution-set to addressing the various problems at stake.</p>\n<p>In 2015, MozFest’s overarching focus was on leadership, advocacy and impact: <em>We’ll train tomorrow’s leaders, empower participants to make a positive difference on the web, and work toward universal web literacy</em>.</p>\n<p>We named the Space Digital Citizenship to align with the focus on skills-building around advocacy. We invited experts on human rights, cyberbullying and online harassment, mobilization and community building, and tools-building to share their knowledge.

With strong collaboration, we helped identify solid proposals within each of their Spaces, effectively creating a curated “policy &amp; advocacy pathway” across MozFest.

The approach was appealing and I was keen on -experimenting with<br />\nthe design of our Privacy &amp; Security Space. But lack of time and experience made us focus on other necessities.</p>\n<p>That year at the festival, as I was looking for Sessions related to queer/LGBTIQA+ topics, I only found a couple in the schedule. The session I attended, ‘Queering Privacy through Queer Hacking’ led by security researcher Sarah Lewis, was full.</p>\n<p>The year after, I attended MozRetreat in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, and had no clear idea of what I would do as a Space Wrangler for the next MozFest edition. This turned out to be an excellent thing: the Retreat is designed to help people build their vision for the festival, but it also provides time and resources to find brand new ideas.</p>\n<p>In Eindhoven, we were immersed in an environment fostering experiments combining art and tech. One afternoon, designer Olle Lundin presented the “Queering the Collection” and “Deviant Practices” programmes at the Van Abbemuseum, a museum of modern and -contemporary art located in central Eindhoven. Lundin presented queering as a practice, as a way to give -visibility to LGBTIQA+ folks in art, and as a way to occupy space at the museum in a different way and engage with visitors.</p>\n<p>The idea clicked for what we could do at MozFest: replace ‘art’ by ‘tech’, ‘museum’ by ‘MozFest’ and you’ve got the start of the Queering MozFest Experience.</p>\n<p>Chosing the label ‘queer’ instead of ‘LGBTQIA+’ was on purpose. By ‘queering’ the festival, we wanted to look at the world in a way that challenges what we expect to be ‘normal’, and to be the norm. As such, ‘queer’ allows us to position our gender and sexuality in a way that questions normalization and marginalization processes inside the white, ableist, cissexist, hetero-patriarchal, and capitalist system. It is about how our bodies and our practices which are deemed abnormal, strange, or dangerous still exist, resist, and occupy space inside our societies. And we connected this queering experience with tech issues.</p>\n<p>At MozFest, we wanted to encourage LGBTQIA+ folks to submit sessions about topics they cared about. This meant drafting a dedicated call for proposals for this Space and engaging directly with them/us to explain what we meant to achieve, both inside and outside the MozFest Wrangling teams.</p>\n<p>We also closely collaborated with queer designers and artists to develop a ‘queer territory’ within the festival – to bring the weird and unexpected stuff.</p>\n<p>We received about 30 proposals during the call for proposals and accepted 17 of them. Thanks to the help of the Space Wranglers, we were able to embed most of the Sessions in all areas of the festival for maximum visibility and outreach: Privacy &amp; Security, Openness, Decentralisation, Digital Inclusion, and the Youth Zone. Artists also displayed their works in the Data+Art gallery and we set up a Queer Space to host specific sessions throughout the weekend, next to a lounge space and a giant unicorn.</p>\n<p>The Queering MozFest experience was kicked off during the Plenary Session of the festival, for all to see and hear.</p>\n<p>We were everywhere. As we very likely have always been, but not in such a visible and open way!</p>\n<p>According to the feedback we got before, during and after the festival, the Queering MozFest Experience apparently struck a chord with people. In 2019, a new team had taken the lead to make it happen again: within the same frame of respect and inclusion, it will mutate and explore new directions.

Platforms and languages that became popular and don’t ensure compatibility delegate an important burden on their users: the users have to keep up the pace with the changes. They need to constantly update their applications to ensure they will keep working. At each major evolution, such platforms risk losing users who don’t have the time to update it.</p>\n<p>The web took the other path, choosing to maintain backward compatibility.</p>\n<p>As any extension to the web platform will stay forever, at least as soon as websites start using it – the task of the browser makers is daunting. Each new feature has to be carefully evaluated: usefulness, design, security must be studied to be sure it will not bloat the system or be a hazard in the future. This is a complex task and it takes several years for a new feature to go from the design stage to production-ready and stable.</p>\n<p>Over the years, decentralisation, while positive in most regards, is not picture perfect. The internet, networks and web protocols are all decentralised – distributed servers host different websites – which means more and more complex services are needed that are not a part of the official infrastructure. For example, mapping services, and speech recognition websites are complex and are usually hosted remotely by large companies. This concentration of features is a centralisation force: even if the infrastructure itself stays decentralised, these features aren’t. As more and more services are needed, the decentralisation of the web is again a challenge.</p>\n<p>Similarly, large social media services try to create silos for content in order to keep their customers. They ease the publication and discoverability of the content but make sharing outside the silo difficult. These silos undermine the original fundamental decentralisation of the web: and create bubbles, that coupled with targeted advertisements, can segregate a specific population, altering its perception of the world.</p>\n<p>The web has also attracted all kinds of bad actors to a platform that has not been designed to resist such threats: identity theft, bullying online, fake news, and discrimination by both users and Artificial Intelligence, and countless other issues invade our -digital world. These problems are openly and heavily debated. The solutions may be technical, but as they limit the legendary freedom of the web, public awareness is critical.</p>\n<h2>MozFest: A solution and a challenge for our generation</h2>\n<p>Open forums and discussions are fundamental in maintaining the success of both technologic and humane advances of the web.

Taking over Ravensbourne’s ground floor, the Pop-Up represented twelve partner organisations from the Hive. Each organisation brought an activity for youth. Around 60 young people flocked to the Space. In an activity facilitated by New York City’s DreamYard art center, they imagined their ideal tech-enabled creative hang-out space and molded tiny furniture to fill it. They collected audio interviews with youth radio initiative Radio Rookies, designed board games with New York-based Institute of Play, and much more.</p>\n<p>The 2011 Hive Pop-Up laid the groundwork for the Youth Zone in the years to come: a collaboratively produced Space, with a focus on play, exploration, imagination, risk-taking, failure, and discovery for young people — and the young at heart.

In 2012, new partners came on board including educators from Black Girls Code, Coder Dojo, London Zoo, the creative technology non-profit MOUSE, Digital Me, and Global Action Project.

As it turns out these boxes were designed in a way that the cover would sit flush with the rest of the floor, with a hole at the edge for cables to run through. If you didn’t quite arrange the cable correctly, the cable would sit between the lid and the lip of the box, pinched between the two. Add to this a day’s worth of people walking over the box and the insulation of the cable was slowly worn&#8230; At that point – BOOM – you get an electrical short, resulting in a flash of light, an audible bang, and a quick trip to the building management team with your tail between your legs as you very politely ask them to flip the breaker back on.</p>\n<p>In theory, that electrical fault could have easily caused a much wider issue – it only took out power for the single floor, but as Ravensbourne University is located right next to the concert venue O2, the possible consequences are obvious. O2 also happened to provide my mobile phone’s service, so you can imagine how awkward that “I’m sorry for causing an outage” phone call would have been!

Education early adopters were armed with paperback copies of Seymore Papert’s <em>Mindstorms: Children,</em><br />\n<em>Computers, and Powerful Ideas</em>, and issues of <em>Make Magazine</em>. We were ready to program, not be programmed!</p>\n<p>Mozilla and our allies were excited to participate in the emerging movement of foundations, non-profits, universities, governments, start-ups and grass roots educators. Digital storytelling, web mechanics, coding, new tools — helping to define what it means to be literate in the 21st Century. It felt current, important, and fun. We knew that teaching a holistic set of digital skills was more than just learning to code or building out the STEM career pipeline. We believed it was an evolution of the fundamental skills and competencies needed to read and decipher the frighteningly fast world around us. This wasn’t just a new subject, this was a seismic shift in how the world works and civil society better figure out how to teach the web. We wanted to help.</p>\n<p>Looking back on 10 years of this work, the pivotal moment for Mozilla’s focus on web literacy was the development of the Hackasaurus web tool (later renamed X-Ray Goggles). From the imaginations of two friends and collaborators, Jess Klein and Atul Varma, this web app would allow you to turn on a view source tool that lets you see, understand, edit and re-publish the web. It was like having special glasses that revealed a deeper, more detailed reality than what loaded in your browser, often referred to as a peek behind the web screen. Mozilla had found a curricular inspiration for our ideas around being web literate.</p>\n<p>Emanating from the spark Hackasaurus/X-Ray Goggles provided Mozilla and the forming open digital education community it was coraling, Mozilla launched the first Summer Code Party in 2012. This amplified Mozilla’s efforts to teach how to read, write, and participate on the web at global scale. Mozilla’s Hive Learning Networks where crucial to building communities in local cities like NYC, Toronto, Chicago, Pittsburgh and others to help develop the web literacy skills of youth while catalyzing local movements to help educators innovate in digital learning. Together Summer of Code Party (renamed Maker Party in 2013) and Hive Learning Networks were supporting a movement of teaching crucial 21st century skills and web literacy to informal educators, teachers, and advocates. By 2015, there were thousands of “Maker Parties” in hundreds of cities every year, teaching people of all ages to learn the web.</p>\n"},{"type":"image","image":{"src":"/media/Hackasaurus-1.jpg","srcset":"/media/Hackasaurus-1-375x0-c-default.jpg 375w, /media/Hackasaurus-1-500x0-c-default.jpg 500w, /media/Hackasaurus-1-750x0-c-default.jpg 750w, /media/Hackasaurus-1-1000x0-c-default.jpg 1000w","caption":"Mozilla’s X-Ray Goggles Homepage","alt":"Screenshot of Mozilla’s Hackasaurus X-Ray Goggles homepage","width":1000,"height":385}},{"type":"text","text":"<p>X-Ray Goggles helped begat a string of web making tools like Thimble, Popcorn Maker, and AppMaker.

These web making tools helped seed further innovation in other popular web tools and projects such as the Hour of Code, Glitch, and Scratch.</p>\n<p>There also needed to be a rigorous rationale to bring the concept of web literacy closer to the mainstream of academic thought and practical application. The Web Literacy Map, co-created by Doug Belshaw (Open Educational Thinker) and the Mozilla community, and further developed by An-Me Chung (Fellow at CS4ALL) and partners, was a matrix of skills and competencies one needed to be web literate. This framework has since been adopted, remixed, and evolved as people in wider education communities pick up the map and advance them in their own local contexts. This think tank style work was validated by the Brookings Institute when it published an article in their Skills for A Changing World series written by Mozilla’s Executive Director Mark Surman and Mozilla Fellow Meghan McDermott.

During MozFest’s first year in Barcelona, web literacy was a space where individuals would gather to discuss the question of “what do -people need to thrive online and how do we help them?”. Now, in the 10th year of MozFest, it is a Space for a movement that seeks to make web literacy a core modern skill along with reading, writing, and maths. It has been a gathering space for projects with audacious goals like “Cities of Learning”, “Computer Science for All”, and “Open Education.”</p>\n<p>None of this was by accident, the simple pleasure of teaching and learning has always been at the core of the MozFest design. Participatory and self guided, but well organized and conceived, is the pedagogical mission of the event and the best ways for people to gain digital skills. The web literacy spaces through the years have been able to balance a wide range of educators, youth, scholars, developers and activists, holding both the technical and metaphorical aspects in tandem. Over the decade the Spaces were curated and lead by a wide range of Mozilla Staff, community members, and UK edtech champions like Su Adams and Dorine Flies.</p>\n<p>MozFest served as the crucial point of the year where the global community would come together to learn and share their experiences. Leading by example, web literacy programming was hands-on and engaging by nature and focused on individuals of all ages sharing games, technology, and programs that taught web literacy. Individuals gathered to test new tools like Erase all Kittens, or develop new learning games, or share what worked in their Mozilla Club in Kenya, or explore digital animation through green screens.</p>\n<p>The web literacy program areas always had flair. From -bedazzled lab coats to circus chic themes, the participants always enjoyed the curated Space. One year you entered a Carnival of Learning where you could demystify the web, or as Space Wrangler Kim Wilkens explained, “Embrace the unknown! Experience the thrills! Imagine and share the full potential of the web with everyone!” Other years we threw giant Maker Parties where local youth and international digital learning organizations made, played, and learned together.

Educators from Yorkshire to California are testing ‘Open Badges’, a brand-new means of capturing and expanding achievements made on a local scale onto the world wide web. From working with young people to veterans, from coding to cookery, these educators ignite a passion for learning, leading to personal developments in curiosity and problem-solving, both easily applicable in other real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, this type of inspired learning is often overlooked by the education system.</p>\n<p>It is generally agreed that the old model, where schools and universities have sole responsibility for learning, is outdated and slow to change.

This can lead to a collapse in self-esteem and talented people are easily overlooked.</p>\n<p>So how can we move towards a situation where education offered online and in new, informal settings is placed on equal footing with institutional learning?

They are awarded to individuals and signify achievements, from completing a code club project to attaining a formal qualification. Each digital badge is packed with data, providing context about the achievement – who did something, evidence of what they did, and who says they did it, all of which can be digitally verified in real-time.</p>\n<p>These new digital credentials are the result of a collaboration between Mozilla and MacArthur Foundation, who saw the opportunity to harness the power of the internet to give individuals, employers, and educators a new common language to communicate skills across the web in any given setting.

Open Badges made significant progress within two years. The recognition granted through the project enabled new-found confidence for learners and helped people tell the story of their learning.</p>\n<p>Research on effective badge design was published in ‘Promising Practices of Open Credentials’ by Sheryl L. Grant and learning providers began using credentials to demonstrate the impact of their programmes. Although the project had a positive impact within organisations, learners wanted to know how they could use their credentials beyond education to build their own enterprise or access job opportunities.</p>\n<p>So while Open Badges showed the potential to deliver global societal benefits, employers, educators, and platforms would all need to embrace the standard. The ‘badge ecosystem’ was supplying badges, and it now needed to generate demand for them. Only then could individuals use them as currency to unlock opportunities for work or further learning.</p>\n<p>A stalemate had arisen. Learners and educators wanted proof that employers would recognise badges, whereas employers needed proof that educators would issue badges. Platforms and governments wanted to know whether Open Badges would become the global standard for sharing skills across the web before committing. In short, only once the whole system became connected could learners’ genuinely benefit from opportunities outside of their organisation.</p>\n<p>MozFest provided Open Badges with the platform to widen its community base. The festival is like a pop-up city, embodying the values of interest-led, hands-on learning where everyone is invited to join in.

A beautiful consequence of this model is that the “experts” often enjoy substantial new learnings as they articulate their knowledge and experience in new and creative fashions.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that some participants will feel uncomfortable in these unfamiliar settings. Sitting in circular arrangements, not able to hide behind laptops, divorced from conventional “expertise hierarchies” and unsure of what comes next.

These are individuals who understand the community dynamics in play, and strive to see the needs of fellow participants served. This can be through offering to facilitate sessions that have been requested, by mediating and de-escalating disagreements and tensions, or by communicating to event organizers concerns or feedback they have observed.

Meeting rooms should be well-lit and comfortable, with adequate space for participants to sit in a single large circle, and good sound dynamics to assure that even the most soft-spoken individuals are heard. Proper name tags that emphasize first names and de-emphasize last names, titles and affiliations are a powerful lubricant for ad-hoc interactions. And food sourcing is critical: good food (with particular care to individual dietary needs) leads to productive moods, and an ongoing supply of beverages that includes a bottomless pot of coffee keeps people fuelled, hydrated, and ready to fully focus on the proceedings. Breaks should be frequent and not short, both to allow freestyle interactions, and to let participants check in with external realities so they can turn full attention to subsequent sessions.</p>\n"},{"type":"text-scaling","text":"<p>Breaks should be frequent and not short, both to allow freestyle interactions, and to let participants check in with external realities so they can turn full attention to subsequent sessions.</p>\n"},{"type":"text","text":"<h2>What Can Go Wrong?</h2>\n<p>While participatory events can yield a bounty of substantial and serendipitous outcomes, the model is not without risk.

A specific challenge lies in not rushing the schedule; collaboration evolves along its own timeline, and Facilitators who rush participants in order to track to stated agenda time slots undermine the effectiveness of the sessions themselves.

To do this, we celebrate prior achievements of the festival and acknowledge the hard work of others not in the room. And of course, the best part of this initial phase is bonding with one another. MozRetreat is the only time that this group will be together in person until the week of the festival. After the event, everyone will return to their different corners of the globe and subsequent connections happen via video and conference calls, so it’s vital that trusting relationships are forged.</p>\n<p>Stage two of the retreat is about defining the evolution of MozFest by acknowledging parts of the event that are stale and could use revamping, or that represent exciting new territory we’ve never approached. We ask participants to define where they see their own work fitting in, what they are passionate about working on, and who else should be part of the conversation. It is here that roles begin to take shape, and the individuals who will lead the festival’s Spaces and experiences emerge: these are the MozFest Wranglers.</p>\n<p>Wranglers have a deep history and play a critical role. They design and host the Spaces, experiences, and connections within the festival where others can participate and thrive. It is at the Wrangler level that the co-ownership of MozFest exists most profoundly. At MozRetreat, we give Wranglers driving lessons, then hand them the keys to the car.</p>\n"},{"type":"text-scaling","text":"<p>We trust these Wranglers to create something personal that is also an accessible, engaging inroad for MozFest attendees to contribute to a healthy web that matters in their communities.</p>\n"},{"type":"text","text":"<p>Not everyone at the retreat chooses to become a Wrangler and there are many other ways one can contribute to MozFest’s design and delivery. The agenda gives space and opportunity so folks can change their minds, move around programmatically, form teams, and bring other ideas to the table. If Wrangler teams are not gelling, we step in to help.<br />\nIf someone becomes lost in the swirl of ideas, we guide them to find a focus that feels right.</p>\n<p>The final stage of MozRetreat is about making commitments to do the work required and clarifying next steps, like writing the call for proposals. Co-designing a participatory festival is no small task. Combined, the team will dedicate thousands of volunteer hours so it’s critical that the work is distributed as evenly as possible, and that everyone has an opportunity to contribute. This is where the festival production team brings more structure to the process by setting milestones for the curation of sessions, the allocation of travel stipends, and the physical design of festival Spaces and experiences. We outline how the work in these areas is coordinated across various roles, what we expect of the Wranglers, and how we support them in return.</p>\n<p>MozRetreat is an exhilarating, empowering, and highly productive week. It is a key moment in the co-ownership and co-design of the festival: we present a desired outcome and hand the reins to this group to design how we get there. We trust these Wranglers to create something personal that is also an accessible, engaging inroad for MozFest attendees to contribute to a healthy web that matters in their communities.</p>\n<h2>Planning across time zones</h2>\n<p>Post-retreat, Wranglers work together in teams to curate proposals, support Facilitators, design the Space, and schedule the sessions. With many moving pieces to coordinate, we convene in a weekly call, an important mechanism to stay connected, share design updates, raise issues, request peer assists, and ask questions. Documentation is important here, and we capture notes in a central document, record calls for viewing at a later time, and send update emails and task lists that explain the procedures.</p>\n<p>During the months between the retreat and the festival, the production team governs the federated design process and keeps the work moving to meet the deadlines necessary to produce the festival. Access to our team is paramount, whether at the end of Wrangler calls, in smaller groups, or 1:1. We regularly ask for input on our process and iterate as necessary according to the feedback.</p>\n"},{"type":"side-image","text":"","images":[{"src":"/media/Wranglers-on-a-zoom-call.png","srcset":"/media/Wranglers-on-a-zoom-call-375x0-c-default.png 375w, /media/Wranglers-on-a-zoom-call-500x0-c-default.png 500w, /media/Wranglers-on-a-zoom-call-750x0-c-default.png 750w, /media/Wranglers-on-a-zoom-call-1000x0-c-default.png 1000w","caption":"Wranglers meet weekly on a zoom call","alt":"Group shot of people in a zoom call with gallery pictures","width":1300,"height":831}]},{"type":"text","text":"<h2>On-site</h2>\n<p>Wranglers will spend five months preparing for MozFest.

By creating an accessible environment where people of all types can collaborate and flourish, Wranglers nurture a vibrant, welcoming atmosphere.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the Spaces that Wranglers design function as mini-festivals. Within each Space, participants can find everything they need: sessions, inspiring talks, art installations, and community.

Straightforward presentations are discouraged, unless Facilitators are asking attendees to openly collaborate on their work.</p>\n<p>Once the call for proposals closes and Wranglers have completed their curation, we typically end up with more that 500 individual Facilitators. Wranglers manage the Facilitator relationship by sending emails, hosting open calls, and providing 1:1 guidance as needed. Oftentimes, veteran Facilitators are invited to share their experience and advice.</p>\n<h2>Federated Design in action</h2>\n<p>Again, documentation plays an important role in setting up Facilitators to succeed as festival co-owners. We wrote a Facilitator Handbook to help newbies navigate the very unique MozFest experience, and to guide everyone in the planning and delivery of a great Session. It shares many practical details like where nursing mothers can feed their infants, what dietary restrictions we can accomodate, and the location of the prayer room.</p>\n<p>We also host a half-day Facilitator Orientation on the Friday of the festival weekend. The central goal of this mandatory convening is to establish an ethos of shared ownership of the festival across the diverse range of Wranglers and Facilitators present, and to invite each and every one of them to see themselves as ambassadors of MozFest and the community, spreading goodwill while remaining cognizant of anything that limits others’ ability to enjoy the event.</p>\n<p>Facilitators are encouraged to provide feedback directly to their Wranglers, and also to production Staff. With 500+ Facilitators, this generates a fantastic range of responses that guide the program design the following year.</p>\n<h2>Arrive with an idea, leave with a community</h2>\n<p>When discussing shared ownership of MozFest, we cannot forget the participants. Our invitation is an explicit call to shape the future of the web and attendees arrive ready to share ideas and get their hands dirty – whether that means writing code, designing games, teaching others, or any of the countless ways to connect and collaborate.</p>\n<p>With more than 600 activities taking place over the festival weekend, participants cannot possibly attend every Session, visit every interaction, or take in every talk. Immediately following the opening plenary, attendees disperse to all corners of the building, a highly personal migration that invites each individual person to design their own journey and set their own pace. Those who dash from Session to Session, committed to seeing as much as humanly possible, create a playful, frenetic energy, while those who settle in to long conversations in Ravensbourne’s many cozy corners remind us that serendipitous connections are one of the festival’s greatest rewards.</p>\n<p>A third of our participants are also Facilitators who are hosting their own activity as some point during the weekend, meaning a huge portion of the audience are bringing their expertise and support to others’ sessions.

It&#8217;s been a long time since I wrote “Cyberia” and you founded The Webbys. Back then we both thought the best way to  promote a healthy digital society was to celebrate those who were envisioning and engineering positive, pro-social futures. But around the time of the AOL-Time Warner merger, around 1999, it became clear to me — and I&#8217;m guessing to you, too — that the net was about to be more about the growth of capital than the growth of culture. As a result, we got the surveillance economy and the attention economy, which instead of helping people create value for themselves and each other, simply use tech to extract value from people and places. Right about that time is when I wrote this weird little piece for Adbusters called “The Sabbath Revolt,” where I was arguing that people should adopt a “one-seventh rule.” One day each week, not just away from tech, but away from buying and selling. Taking a day off would help people recalibrate their nervous systems and their social priorities.</p>\n","<p>It kind of fell on flat ears. But now with Day of Unplugging and your book “24/6” and Tristan Harris convincing tech companies to show us how much time we&#8217;re spending,  I&#8217;m wondering: Is the amount of time we spend on our devices as important as how we&#8217;re spending time?</p>\n"]},{"participant":"tiffany-shlain","text":["<p>For the last 10 years, my family and I unplug completely from all screens for one day a week, which has been extremely profound.

Then when it became centralised, the priorities changed and it was about sucking in all your time and monetising every moment of your life. So for me, the book is about a multi-pronged approach. One, you need a full day off the network once a week. Twenty-four hours is necessary to do the long-term thinking we&#8217;re not able to when we&#8217;re jacked into the network 24/7. You need the space to do the kind of thinking that drives culture forward.</p>\n","<p>Secondly, we need to change the models that are happening with the web. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a mistake that there&#8217;s a reckoning in the gender movement and the tech movement at the same time. We need more diversity at every level of when we’re creating these tools.</p>\n","<p>So to answer your question: It&#8217;s not just about disconnecting. You need time away — real time away. Not just a couple hours before bed, but a full day off every week to regain perspective and bigger picture thinking.</p>\n","<p>And we need more diversity in the creation, oversight and regulation of everything having to do with technology and the web.

Specifically, we were talking about the public sector delegating difficult internet regulation tasks — like counter-terrorism, intellectual property protection, or hate speech — to private actors.</p>\n","<p>There is some degree of consensus in the European policy space that there’s a problem with law enforcement on social media. And in some respects, that even goes beyond law enforcement. Like in the UK, you had these initiatives around so-called harmful speech that actually isn&#8217;t illegal, but it&#8217;s considered a problem anyway. Yet there is no consensus about what exactly should be done about it.</p>\n","<p>So, my impression is that the policy response is focusing on shifting the liability for illegal activities to the platforms, rather than the people who actually commit illegal acts. Because then it&#8217;s not the lawmakers’ problem anymore. Basically they&#8217;re telling a social media company, “There is crime happening, fix it” — fully knowing that any tools that would promise anything close to 100% success would have huge rates of false positives, and would violate fundamental rights.</p>\n","<p>But since they&#8217;re not prescribing any specific method to deal with this problem, the public sector can somewhat abdicate any responsibility for the negative effects. In my view, that&#8217;s a cop out. It&#8217;s also dangerous in the long run:<br />\nIf you&#8217;re not willing to take responsibility for how the law is enforced, then you&#8217;re giving up power and you&#8217;re basically telling a company like Facebook, “You are in charge of what is allowed and what is not allowed.”</p>\n","<p>And of course, a company like Facebook is not going to enforce the law. They&#8217;re going to enforce their private community rules that go way beyond the law in a lot of ways. So again, it&#8217;s dangerous to abdicate responsibility for what we consider acceptable speech to a private company and accept whatever their standards are for society at large.</p>\n"]},{"participant":"malavika-jayaram","text":["<p>There are three things in what you said that really resonated for me. One is this idea of false positives. On a lot of platforms — as well as initiatives that I see in Asia, whether it&#8217;s biometric IDs or facial recognition — they don&#8217;t care about the false positives or the false negatives, because there&#8217;s this narrative that something is better than nothing. That&#8217;s particularly true of developing economies where they feel, “These are people without consent. They are either digitally illiterate or actually illiterate. They don&#8217;t understand the consequences of what is being developed.”</p>\n","<p>So this idea of false positives and false negatives is seen as acceptable in order to improve and fine tune a system. And in countries where you don&#8217;t have a lot of guardrails, whether legally or technically, a progress narrative will push through imperfect systems, just because it&#8217;s seen as something in the fight against big social harms.</p>\n","<p>When I&#8217;ve done work on things like biometric IDs, I&#8217;ve almost thought that they’re beta test-ing surveillance technology on groups and populations in marginalised communities that don&#8217;t have the ability to refuse to be included. And it&#8217;s a similar thing when it comes to the sort of privatisation that you’re talking about: It&#8217;s a privatisation of something that should be within the domain of government and law enforcement. But it&#8217;s being delegated to people who aren&#8217;t necessarily the right fit.</p>\n","<p>The second thing you said that resonates with me is privatisation. It&#8217;s exactly the same in a lot of domains, whether it&#8217;s trying to create a smart city, or whether it&#8217;s in China or India or somewhere where governments are not necessarily the best purveyors of technology. Governments enter public-private partnerships on everything from health systems, to transport, to energy, to a whole lot of things that are not just about free speech or expression. They’re about very civic basic needs — needs that are very, very crucial to daily life.</p>\n","<p>Those are things that are within the domain of governments; that&#8217;s what you pay taxes for. So the idea that those are delegated or even abdicated to private actors is a very disturbing trend. If it was differently designed, I would be happy with the idea of decentralisation. But I don&#8217;t like the increasing monopolisation and platformisation of many services. When you delegate public accountability to private actors that act in self interest and that don&#8217;t necessarily act in the interests of citizens, that&#8217;s a very fundamental shift. You&#8217;re going from a social contract to terms and conditions set by private players.</p>\n","<p>Julia, you touched on this in your email yesterday: You have certain rights and expectations when it comes to a government player, whether under the constitution, whether it&#8217;s tort law, negligence, consumer protection, or labor laws. Those are rights you may have against a government actor, but that you might lose if services are provided by private actors.</p>\n","<p>And the third thing that resonated is, what kind of incentives are we creating when we are pushing this onto private actors? In many ways it&#8217;s creating the wrong incentives, like for citizens to increasingly act less as citizens and to act more as users. At the Stockholm Internet Forum, Alix Dunn from the Engine Room said the only two industries where she ever hears people refer to “users” are the tech industry and the drug industry.</p>\n"]},{"participant":"julia-reda","text":["<p>You&#8217;re right.</p>\n"]},{"participant":"malavika-jayaram","text":["<p>I&#8217;d never thought of it that way.

For example, we don&#8217;t actually have a European criminal law that defines what constitutes criminal hate speech on a European level. Most countries have some sort of national law. Some of them don&#8217;t have criminal hate speech. There are codes of conduct and soft law initiatives.

For example, the idea of originality, or the ideas of parody and criticism and caricature, are losing importance in copyright law. Because an algorithm can only do pattern matching and can only determine, “Is the copyrighted content there? Then it&#8217;s probably an infringement. Is it not there? Then it&#8217;s not an infringement.”</p>\n","<p>The same is probably true in the criminal context, when they use algorithms for criminal sentences. An algorithm cannot evaluate the severity of a crime or the harm that was caused. But it can evaluate the likelihood of reoffending or other things that can be statistically inferred.

I think copyright is actually one of the harder problems, because whether it&#8217;s illegal or not is context-dependent.

People haven’t figured out as a community exactly what it means. One thing that is helping to crystallize it is open hardware licenses; protecting your intellectual property (IP) helps to focus definitions.</p>\n","<p>In software, there are GPL, BSD, etc. licenses, and people understand what they do. People misuse GPL on hardware, which you can’t do. I personally prefer the CERN OHL license. I had a chance to look at the latest draft: I like where it’s going, but there are some loopholes that allow people to cross my definition of open hardware.</p>\n","<p>It’s drafted in a way that allows people to close portions of their design by wrapping it into a physical module, like a breakout board, and then making only the specs of the module’s interfaces open source. So long as the module is available for sale, the license provisions haven’t been violated. The original intent was to allow people to not have to provide source for, say, a resistor, as that is a physical module that’s available for sale. But I can see how the provision could be abused to allow people to put the open hardware label on stuff that’s mostly closed source. In the end, the trade-off seems to stem from the OHL being more concerned about getting people to open up the physical design kits for chips and FPGAs, and less concerned about circuit boards. I think their hearts are in the right place, at least.</p>\n","<p>To close the “module loophole,” I like to think in terms of layers. For example: circuit board layer, chip layer, chassis layer. Typically people tend to focus on a single layer or specialty, and if you want to wave the open hardware banner, then everything related to the things you’ve designed at your layer specialty or skill domain should be open; everything else is a component or library you’ve had to source, and you can’t be expected to make those open because they are outside your lane. So, if you are a silicon vendor doing RTL, all the RTL should be open; if you’re a board designer making PCBs, all the schematics and layouts should be open. What you can make, you make open; don’t play games and claim you’re open while trying to hold key secrets back from the community.</p>\n"]},{"participant":"allen-gunn","text":["<p>You have said in public talks that the future of open hardware is bright.

It’s harder to make faster and faster chips for the same cost, so the innovation cycle is slowing down; new products are no longer as differentiated any more.</p>\n","<p>Open source communities have fewer resources, so we tend to do development in our spare time. Now that the fundamental treadmill of Moore’s law is slowing down, it limits how fast closed source efforts can move ahead. This means open source developers can keep going at the pace we were going and maybe have a chance to develop enough momentum around open standards to push the scales past a tipping point where closed source producers may have trouble competing.</p>\n"]},{"participant":"allen-gunn","text":["<p>What sorts of time frames do you ascribe to bringing that bright future to pass?

I would say since I gave that first talk about the “bright future,” we have passed one key milestone, which is that the “entry-level maker thing” now has the same CPU you would find in a mobile phone. Back then, it was Arduino versus a ~500MHz CPU, but now the Raspberry Pi has basically the same CPU as a midtier mobile phone. This means the baseline of the open hardware ecosystem is approaching that of the closed hardware ecosystem. That change took four to six years. So, I think it’s going to be another five to 10 years before we start to see this baseline hardware turning into system-level standards that start to give closed source solutions a run for their money.</p>\n","<p>Another thing that would be good to see — and probably coming soon — is a really good open source WiFi reference design, and an open source desktop motherboard reference design. If you read the rhetoric, the Open Compute Project is trying to do that — but you need credentials to see the docs. That is not open.</p>\n","<p>Once we have these core fundamental elements opened up, the ecosystem will need to figure out conventions around manufacturing, so there is an economy of scale you can get by sharing common parts between designs. If we all agree to use particular conventions for capacitors or power supplies, then you can get a real economy of scale, as manufacturers can share production across many projects.

So, I think down to around 20nm — the FinFET barrier — there is a reasonably good chance someone will do an open PDK. Especially if there is an industry downturn.

For example, with Apple’s “Genius Bar,” you can see the religification of hardware, a.k.a. brand loyalty. I’m not saying people have to know how to design a circuit board. What they need to know is it’s a thing humans design, not gods. The reason it’s important to talk about open source hardware is not because everyone needs to get a screwdriver, but because everyone needs to know someone in their immediate social circle who understands technology.

We need an algorithmic “white box”.</p>\n<p>To find solutions, a merger of knowledge, experience, ideas and peer connections by diverse groups is needed – including lawyers, tech experts, activists, academics. Several actions should go in parallel, to ensure protection and promotion of Trustworthy AI:</p>\n"},{"type":"bullets","bullets":["<p>First, we need more insight into how algorithmic systems are designed and used, to understand their impact on rights and explore possibilities to use them for good. This can be done by creating a crowdsourced platform on the “trust in AI systems for civic rights” to channel information on ways technology and algorithmic systems are used by governments, companies or organisations on rights of association, assembly, expression, participation. Learning can be mapped to inform policy advocacy actions. Research on technological solutions, individual actions and navigation tactics can help create practical guidelines to protect and promote these rights.</p>\n","<p>Second, we need to address how to practically ensure human rights centred design of algorithmic systems. According to the University of Birmingham research team, such design means that algorithmic systems will be human-rights compliant and reflect the core values that underpin the rule of law. It entails systematic consideration of human rights concerns at every stage of system design, development and implementation. The research team proposed translating human rights norms into software design processes and software requirements. Developers seem to become ‘moral guardians’ of our rights – but they are not always aware how the solutions they develop may be purposefully manipulated or inadvertently used to stifle rights and freedoms.</p>\n","<p>Finally, there is a need for consistent, meaningful and transparent consultation with stakeholders, including civil society, movements, academics, tech community, and media. In particular, the needs of vulnerable groups should be heard, ensuring that impact of algorithmic systems can be monitored, debated and addressed.</p>\n"]},{"type":"text","text":"<p>We must develop broader knowledge-building networks and exchange learnings on practical implementation.  As a community, we can apply a forward-looking approach and map, explore and unpack these issues.

This is the second time that an announced protest has been banned due to “fairly accurate prediction of violence during the protest” by AuRii – a new government’s algorithm for predictive analytics. AuRii has been analysing tweets about the announced protest in the last 24 hours and its verdict seems clear – there is 86% chance of violent clashes. Activists are appalled by its decision, calling for investigation into how AuRii makes such predictions. In addition, it seems that bots and fake accounts posted most violence-related tweets, pointing to an organized sabotage. Despite public outcry, authorities claim they can’t disclose the analytical works of AuRii.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t heard of AuRii, don’t worry – this news is fictional.

In a study by the Zea Mays Center for Computational Linguistics at the University of Illinois, moralization in social networks and the emergence of violence during protests, using data from 2015 Baltimore protests, the authors created an algorithm that can predict a link between tweets and street action – hours in advance of violence. Such predictive analytics can have various impacts on our rights to express and assemble &#8211; it can be used by the police to plan for disruptive events and divert them, but also to sabotage legitimate public activism and expression, or silence dissent.

The concept of democratization through AI may, however, be premature or unrealistic in the context of African countries. Successful development of AI-based products generally requires large datasets, and Africa has been called a “data desert.” Biodiversity on the continent is high, but genetic databases cataloging such biodiversity are few. Climate change will affect Africa at least as much as other continents, but few countries have dedicated satellites for collecting weather data. It is therefore in the disparity of available data where the divide between implementations of AI in Africa and those of other regions will be most greatly observed.</p>\n<p>An unfortunate exception to the data desert is in data pertaining to personal identity. Many African governments are currently implementing digital identification (ID) systems, and in the process, collecting vast amounts of data about their citizens and residents. Such data is valuable for AI algorithms and can be obtained either through leakage (i.e., data breaches) or, sometimes, through official channels. The Government of Zimbabwe, for example, recently sold a data set containing facial images of Zimbabwe citizens to a Chinese company seeking to improve a facial recognition AI algorithm. The ability (or inability) to control data through law or technology is a barrier to ethical implementation of AI.</p>\n<p>A further substantial barrier to implementation of AI projects in some parts of Africa is the lack of trust in automated systems. In Kenya, for example, ATMs are disfavoured, as most individuals would prefer to carry out banking activities with a human. This preference grows stronger where technology and devices are more opaque, or are developed outside of the country. For the benefits of AI to be realized, then, a change is required in such cultural preferences. Alternatively, AI must be implemented in ways that are invisible to the ordinary user.</p>\n"},{"type":"text-scaling","text":"<p>Ultimately, hiding, obscuring, or downplaying the use of AI will only strengthen the distrust of automated systems.
